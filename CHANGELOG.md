# Changelog

## 2026-04-06

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaDashiBridge.agda` as the first repo-native
  LILA-to-DASHI bridge stub.
  The module packages the existing execution contract together with the
  canonical receipt-layer phase split, so the repo now has a named seam for
  reading LILA as the execution system and DASHI as the admissibility lens.
  Sync `Docs/LILA_DASHI_Bridge.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`
  so the bridge reading is recorded once in prose and once in code.
- add `scripts/delta_cone_lila.py`, `scripts/checkpoint_prime_vectors.py`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaTraceFamily.agda` to turn the bridge into a
  runnable analyzer plus a minimal trace-family lift.
  The scripts operationalize the delta-cone test and the prime-exponent
  checkpoint encoding; the Agda module gives the first trace-row schema that
  can be lifted back into the execution-contract seam.
- add `scripts/run_compare.sh` and `scripts/plot_training_dynamics.py` to
  match the thread's latest recommendation for a minimal credibility package:
  baseline-vs-LILA comparison plus simple training-dynamics plots.
- tighten the bridge UX with `scripts/run_all.sh`, parameterized model
  entrypoints in `scripts/run_compare.sh`, and a short repo-facing usage page
  plus PlantUML flow diagram in `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.md` and
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml`, with the rendered preview in
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`.

## 2026-04-05

- add `scripts/run_agda_easy_to_hard.py` as the simple front-door runner for
  the current validated Agda sequence.
  It executes the known cheap targets in easiest-to-hardest order:
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`,
  `Kernel/Monoid.agda`,
  `Verification/Prelude.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeIsolation.agda`,
  with optional bounded inclusion of
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`
  and optional Layer 2 queue generation at the end.
  Sync `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  intended “easy -> bounded -> queue-only” flow explicitly.

## 2026-04-03

- add `scripts/build_selector_step_coarse_bundle.py` as the first repo-native
  bundle builder for the still-open selector commutation probe.
  It reuses the existing Agda-backed orientation-prime adapter from
  `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` and emits a
  `coarse_step` / `step_coarse` bundle suitable for
  `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py`, with optional inline comparison
  output.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the correct
  boundary:
  this is a bridge-aligned runtime probe built from repo-native source, not a
  full independent evaluator of the `shiftCoarse` / `shiftStep` schedule.

- add `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py` as a cheap runtime probe for the
  still-open selector commutation theorem.
  It compares two concrete `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads already interpreted
  as `coarse(step(x))` and `step(coarse(x))`, then reports whether the
  explicit selector agrees on both sides.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the correct
  boundary explicitly:
  this script is for bounded evidence / counterexample search, not theorem
  discharge.

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda` from a pure
  target surface into a theorem-bearing selector lane.
  The selector is now explicit on the 15-prime carrier:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  `selector-sound` is discharged in Agda by a finite upper-bound proof over
  the SSP carrier, while `selector-no-loss-target` and
  `selector-step-coarse-target` remain the honest open targets.
  Recheck `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py` against the same rule and sync
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md`.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda` and
  `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py` as the next thin selector surface above
  exponent-level concentration.
  The new Agda module packages the remaining selection boundary explicitly as
  selector soundness, selector no-loss under admissible descent, and
  selector/coarse-step commutation targets.
  The new runtime helper implements the current explicit selector rule:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the selection
  gap as a concrete selector theorem problem rather than a vague concentration
  story.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda` and
  `scripts/check_canonical_prime_concentration.py` as the first exponent-level
  concentration surface above the carrier/bridge/support layers.
  The new Agda module defines
  `PrimeWeight`,
  `PrimeDominates`,
  and `PrimeConcentrated` on the canonical 15-prime carrier, proves weight
  transport across the already-landed coarse/step commutation law, and keeps
  the actual selective claims explicit as target surfaces:
  existence of a concentrated prime and no-loss of concentration under the
  current execution admissibility boundary.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records that the next
  gap is now exponent-level concentration rather than support-level
  invariance.

- add `scripts/route_agda_by_layer.py` as a small execution-policy helper
  above the existing Agda validation and Layer 2 queue surfaces.
  It classifies modules into `L0/L1/L2` and routes them to:
  interactive direct runs,
  bounded direct runs,
  or queue-only handoff for the current heavy Hecke Layer 2 lane.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  control-plane rule explicitly:
  the main win is choosing the right execution boundary around Agda, not
  pretending the heavy aggregate modules belong in the interactive loop.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda` as the first
  light support-level theorem layer above the new canonical prime-selection
  bridge.
  The new module proves transport of prime support across the already-landed
  coarse/step commutation law for the transported prime embedding, and it
  also proves the current support-level no-growth statement over the existing
  execution-admissibility boundary.
  The stronger whole-vector / selective MDL concentration story remains open;
  the new module is intentionally support-level rather than a premature
  prime-image equality claim.
  Sync `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the sharper
  selection boundary correctly.

- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda` and
  `scripts/check_canonical_prime_selection_bridge.py` as the first real
  implementation of the canonical prime-selection/signature bridge sketched in
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`.
  The new Agda module packages the currently theorem-bearing closure-side
  pieces:
  prime witness on the transported 15-lane carrier,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported prime embedding,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported Hecke signature,
  and the current lower-bound bridge
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`.
  The stronger MDL concentration and non-accidental isolation clauses remain
  explicit open targets there.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records the exact new boundary correctly.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/MoonshinePrimeCarrierMatch.agda` and
  `scripts/check_monster_prime_carrier_match.py` so the repo can now test the
  legal carrier-level version of “our 15 are those 15” without touching the
  heavy Hecke long-compute lane.
  The new Agda surface proves that the intrinsic `SSP` carrier is exactly the
  canonical 15-prime Monster/Ogg list
  `2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71`, and the Python script checks
  the same equality against the runtime-side catalog.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshineMatch.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  correct boundary explicitly:
  carrier/catalog equality is now implemented, while the stronger claim
  equating `forcedStableCount = 15` with the Ogg/Monster prime set remains
  open.

- extend `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` again so emitted
  batch directories are self-indexing.
  It now writes `index.txt` and `index.json` alongside the shell,
  offline-heavy, by-pair, and by-stage artifacts, so external runners or
  humans can inspect the full batch layout from one place.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  self-indexing batch artifact layout explicitly.

- extend `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py` with a small `--dedupe`
  mode so repeated identical command lines can collapse to a unique offline
  command list while preserving first-seen order.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records both
  rendered-script mode and deduped-command mode explicitly.

- add `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py` as the last small control-plane
  wrapper after queue emission.
  It consumes a Layer 2 batch JSON artifact and renders either raw command
  lines or a runnable bash script, so offline handoff no longer requires
  manually extracting `command_template` entries.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  shell -> queue artifact -> rendered command-list flow explicitly.

- extend `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` so it can now write
  concrete batch artifacts to disk, not just print combined output.
  The emitter now materializes:
  `shell.{txt,json}`,
  `offline-heavy.{txt,json}`,
  and grouped offline-heavy files by pair and by stage.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  new offline handoff mode explicitly while keeping the script queue-only.

- refine `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` so it now emits
  separate compile-thin and offline-heavy batches instead of one flat queue.
  The shell batch is centered on
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`;
  the offline-heavy batch keeps the current three predicted pairs in
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  order. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  sharper shell-first / replay-later control flow explicitly.

- add `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py` as the control-plane
  emitter for the current saturated Layer 2 speedrun.
  It externalizes the fixed three-pair proof order and the stage order
  `sector -> package -> correlation`, and can attach optional
  `agda --parallel` command templates without running the heavy proof lane.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the next practical use of the sibling
  `../agda` performance ideas correctly:
  bounded deterministic queueing first, heavy replay later.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda` as the true compile-thin
  Layer 2 control surface.
  Unlike `Layer2FiniteSearch.agda`, the shell does not import the heavy
  histogram lane; it postulates the fixed pair/stage targets and packages the
  current order only. Extend
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`
  so `Layer2Open` now carries both:
  the compile-thin shell and the heavier logical finite-search package.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the distinction explicitly:
  logical thinness is not compile thinness, and only the shell is a safe
  interactive Agda check.

- add `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearch.agda` as a thin bounded-search
  package over the already-landed Layer 2 proof order.
  It does not add a new Hecke summary surface; it packages the current
  fixed-domain speedrun exactly as
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  on the three predicted saturated-class pairs.
  Extend `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` so
  `Layer2Open` now carries that finite search program explicitly.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the new method boundary correctly:
  the useful lesson from the sibling `../agda` tree is bounded
  proposal/replay-style finite search, not a new invariant layer and not a
  reason to re-run the heavy histogram modules interactively.

- stop treating the old ultrametric signature screen as the execution
  acceptance boundary inside `scripts/regime_test.py`.
  Keep `structural_ok` as a diagnostic field, but switch `joint_ok` and
  `status_class` onto the actual execution-contract clauses the harness
  computes:
  cone,
  MDL/Fejér,
  basin,
  eigen,
  together with arrow.
  Also export the new contract-facing fields (`cone_ok`, `mdl_ok`,
  `execution_non_arrow_ok`, `legacy_*`) so downstream JSON and family
  summaries can distinguish the real acceptance boundary from the old
  signature filter.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records that `regime_test.py` is now on the same
  execution boundary as the new closure-CSV runner.

- wire the new closure-CSV execution-contract runner into the existing batch
  analysis path rather than leaving it as a standalone entrypoint.
  Refactor `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py` into reusable
  evaluation helpers and extend `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` so each
  compatible dataset now records projected-delta execution receipts alongside
  the existing tail-boundary family summaries.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo now records the narrower remaining gap correctly:
  the runner integration is landed, and the residual screening drift lives
  deeper in the older analysis surfaces such as `scripts/regime_test.py`.

- make projection and basin first-class closure-side execution objects rather
  than leaving them only as free predicates inside the contract.
  Add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Projection.agda` for the explicit projection
  carrier plus projected-delta compatibility, add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Basin.agda` for the attractor-relative basin object
  on the projected carrier, and refactor
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContract.agda` to consume both directly
  while preserving the readable receipt layer in
  `ExecutionContractLaws.agda`.
  Add `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py` as the dedicated
  runtime adapter on top of `scripts/execution_contract.py`, so the repo now
  has an explicit closure-CSV execution-contract entrypoint instead of only a
  reusable core enforcer.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the repo records the new boundary correctly:
  projection and basin are now explicit contract objects, and the remaining
  execution gap is no longer “add a runner” but “instantiate these objects
  with richer source-sensitive witnesses”.

## 2026-04-02

- refine the physics-side execution contract instead of inventing a parallel
  execution surface. Add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContractLaws.agda` as a readable receipt/law
  layer above the already-landed `ExecutionContract.agda`, making the five
  obligations explicit:
  arrow,
  projected-delta cone,
  MDL,
  basin,
  eigen overlap.
  Add `scripts/execution_contract.py` as the matching Python projected-delta
  enforcement surface for `closure_embedding_per_step.csv`-style traces. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and `TODO.md` so the repo records the
  execution boundary correctly:
  admissibility is a delta-step contract, not a global `Q(x)` descent rule
  and not a `j-fixed` trace-preservation rule.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/TriadSectorCorrelationRefinement.agda` as the next
  fixed-domain fallback above the ordered triad histogram, and extend
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda` so the same
  three predicted Layer 2 pairs now carry correlation comparison targets as
  well as sector/package histogram targets. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo records the next refinement step explicitly:
  if the triad-histogram lane collapses, move to sector-correlation rather
  than introducing more totals or broadening the taxonomy.
- re-resolve the canonical archived thread
  `Dashi and Physics Insights`
  (`69ca43a9-09fc-839b-8cc3-e5ce3868eef5`,
  canonical ID `ad17536d8eeb320106585654a0950424abafa93b`, source `db`) and
  sync the repo boundary against it. Record in
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` that its earlier `Forced-Stable Transfer Bridge` priority is now
  historical provenance for the previous bridge phase, while the current live
  bottleneck is the fixed-domain Layer 2 separator problem on the saturated
  branch. Extend `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` so
  the packaged Layer 2 status now includes the explicit predicted proof order
  from `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the exact Layer 2 proof order and add
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`. The repo
  now records the recommended fixed-domain comparison sequence explicitly:
  `balancedCycle` vs `supportCascade`,
  `balancedComposed` vs `supportCascade`, then
  `denseComposed` vs `fullSupportCascade`, all tested sector-by-sector before
  whole-package triad comparison. Keep this comparison surface on the same
  long-compute lane as the other histogram refinement modules.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current progress boundary:
  record explicitly that the repo is now in a "Layer 1 closed / Layer 2 open"
  state. On the current taxonomy, the coarse
  `generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact p2 pressure`
  story is complete; the only live mathematical bottleneck is the next
  separating invariant `I₂` on the current saturated branch. Keep the
  histogram/triad-indexed refinement lane on the long-compute list and avoid
  reframing the repo as a total theory before that branch is discharged.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda` to package the
  current Hecke-side status boundary explicitly: Layer 1 is closed on the
  current taxonomy (`generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact
  p2 pressure`), while Layer 2 remains open on the fixed current saturated
  branch (`next separating invariant`). Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo now records the closed-vs-open split directly rather
  than only in prose.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedSectorHistogramComputations.agda` as
  the concrete packaged-data companion to the current fixed-domain
  triad-histogram lane. The module freezes the scope to the already-known
  saturated generator classes and exposes named three-sector histogram
  packages plus the next proof targets in the right order:
  single-sector separation, full packaged separation, or total collapse of
  the packaged refinement on the current scope. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so this module is recorded as a long-compute implementation
  surface rather than an interactively revalidated theorem.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedTriadHistogramSeparation.agda` as the
  current-scope specialization of the triad-indexed refinement lane. The new
  module freezes the domain to the already-classified saturated generator
  taxonomy and states the next honest theorem target there:
  either the triad-indexed histogram separates some current saturated classes,
  or that refinement is exhausted too. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so this fixed-domain triad-histogram question is recorded as the
  next long-compute item rather than an interactively revalidated theorem.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the `3 × 5` refinement boundary:
  record that `Ontology/Hecke/TriadIndexedDefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda`
  now exists as the next candidate refinement surface above the flat current
  orbit-summary histogram, and that
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` now carries both the
  additive `9 + 6` candidate and the multiplicative `3 × 5` factorization on
  the current saturated branch. Keep those Agda checks on the long-compute
  list rather than re-running them interactively.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current `15`-decomposition boundary:
  record that `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` now exist as the first
  implementation surfaces above the collapsed current saturated
  `DefectOrbitSummary`, but that their Agda checks should be treated as
  long-compute items rather than re-run interactively after the prior
  session instability on this class of check.
- sync docs/TODO/context on the current saturated `p2` boundary:
  record that `3` is the generative ternary radix while `15` is only the
  current emergent saturated value of the fixed-prime orbit-summary surface.
  The next structural hypothesis is now stated explicitly as explaining or
  decomposing that `15` (for example by a candidate `9 + 6` split), rather
  than treating `15` itself as primitive.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedOrbitSummaryCollapse.agda` to
  strengthen the current saturated-side negative theorem from the
  `forcedStableCount` field to the whole current `DefectOrbitSummary` at
  `p2`. On the full current saturated generator set, the orbit summary
  already collapses to the same fully stable tuple `(15, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: the next honest separator
  must come from a richer Hecke-side summary/package than the currently
  landed `DefectOrbitSummary`, or from genuinely new generator classes.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentGeneratorPersistenceRefinement.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` to lift the
  current Hecke-side persistence boundary from the original certified finite
  subset to the full current generator taxonomy. The first module gives every
  currently landed generator class an explicit refinement and exact `p2`
  orbit-pressure value, with `supportCascade` now joining the saturated stay
  branch. The second module packages the matching negative theorem on the
  same scope: every currently saturated generator class already has
  `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present `forcedStableCount`-based summary
  is exhausted as a splitter on the whole current taxonomy. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: find a richer Hecke-side
  summary/package that separates the saturated side, or extend the law only
  when genuinely new generator classes land.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SupportCascadePersistence.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` to push both
  active Hecke-side seams one step further. The first extends the current
  persistence story beyond the original certified finite quotient by proving
  that the mixed-scale `supportCascade` stay-class also has exact
  `forcedStableCount = 15` at `p2`. The second packages the matching negative
  fact on the current saturated certified side: every representative there
  already has `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present orbit-summary
  factorization through that field cannot separate the saturated classes any
  further. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: either extend the `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)` law
  beyond the original certified set, or find a richer Hecke-side summary that
  splits the saturated side.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectPersistenceRefinement.agda` as the next honest
  theorem layer above the certified representative persistence quotient. The
  current exact `p2` data now lands as an explicit refinement law:
  collapse time alone does not determine exact Hecke-side orbit pressure, but
  collapse time plus one Hecke-derived stay refinement does. On the current
  certified set, `explicitWidth1` is `lowStay`,
  `explicitWidth3` and `denseComposed` are `highStay`,
  and the current anchored/immediate representatives are `nonStay`. Also
  extend `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` to
  re-export the corresponding certified refinement factorization through the
  full `DefectOrbitSummary`. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: lift this `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)` law beyond the
  current certified set or split the still-saturated side with a richer
  Hecke-side summary than `forcedStableCount` alone.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativeOrbitSummaryPersistence.agda`
  to lift the current certified representative persistence quotient through
  the full Hecke-side `DefectOrbitSummary`. On the current certified set, the
  persistence tier is now recovered by projecting the summary's
  `forcedStableCount` field, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` now re-exports the
  corresponding certified representative orbit-summary factorization. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: lift these Hecke-determined
  certified quotients beyond the current finite set or separate the current
  saturated classes with a richer summary.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativePersistence.agda` as the first
  genuinely collapse-free numeric quotient on the current certified
  representative set. The exact Hecke-side `forcedStableCountOrbitP2` count
  now determines a small persistence tier on that finite domain:
  `explicitWidth1` lands in `reducedPersistence`, while the rest of the
  current certified anchored/immediate plus the other current stay
  representatives land in `saturatedPersistence`. Also strengthen
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` with a certified
  representative orbit-count factorization through that Hecke-determined
  count band. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is
  stated correctly: lift this quotient beyond the current certified set or
  replace it with a richer Hecke-determined persistence/summary theorem.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/StaysVsImmediateRepresentativeOrder.agda` as the first
  tiny discharged numeric witness layer above the current exact `p2` count
  modules. The current certified `staysOneMoreStep` representatives are now
  proved `≤` the current certified `immediateExit` representatives at the
  `p2` forced-stable orbit-count level; the same is now true for the current
  `exitToAnchored` representatives; and the guarded orbit-pressure predicates
  in `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` are concretely discharged
  on those certified sets. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  correctly: move from exact representative counts plus current discharged
  order witnesses to a genuinely Hecke-determined numeric persistence or
  quotient law.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ExitToAnchoredRepresentativeComputations.agda` and
  strengthen `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda`
  plus `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` with
  exact current `p2` count theorems. The three current collapse classes are
  now all represented explicitly on the Hecke side:
  current `immediateExit` and `exitToAnchored` representatives normalize to
  `illegalCountP2 = 15` and `forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 15`, while the
  current `staysOneMoreStep` branch splits as
  `explicitWidth1 ↦ forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 2` and
  `explicitWidth3, denseComposed ↦ 15`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated precisely: discharge the guarded
  pressure predicates from these exact count modules instead of searching for
  more representative-state scaffolding.
- extend `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` with
  assumption-guarded theorem surfaces above the current concrete instances,
  and add `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda` so
  the immediate-exit branch mirrors the already-landed stay-class
  representative computations. The pressure-order module now exposes guarded
  numeric orbit-pressure predicates, while the factorization module now
  exposes guarded defect-summary factorization predicates for a future
  Hecke-determined quotient. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  precisely: discharge those success predicates with concrete `p2`
  representative computations instead of adding more coarse scaffolding.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` above the current
  collapse-to-pressure scaffold. The first module enumerates the current
  certified `staysOneMoreStep` classes through the representative-state
  bridge, exposing their representative state, transported prime image,
  computed `p2` orbit summary, and inherited low-pressure tier. The second
  adds the first theorem-bearing order law on the coarse pressure surface:
  `staysOneMoreStep ≤ exitToAnchored ≤ immediateExit`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated correctly: move from coarse pressure
  order to genuinely Hecke-determined numeric persistence or quotient laws.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapsePressure.agda` and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` above the new
  collapse-time surface. The first module packages a coarse Hecke-side
  pressure classification and representative `p2` pressure summaries above
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda`; the second lands the first
  explicit factorization scaffold from collapse time through that coarse
  defect-pressure summary. Also tighten the comment in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` so `unknownCollapse`
  is recorded as reserved for future classes rather than describing the now
  fully classified current generator set. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next gap is stated
  correctly: strengthen the current collapse-to-pressure dictionary into a
  genuinely Hecke-determined persistence or quotient theorem.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` to close the last
  prefix-side classification hole: `explicitWidth1` is no longer
  `boundaryUnknown`, because the one-hot branch stays in the same
  `π-mdl-max` fibre for one more live step. The collapse-time surface is now
  a coarse three-way observable on the current generator classes:
  `immediateExit`, `exitToAnchored`, and `staysOneMoreStep`. Also add
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda` as the first honest
  Hecke-side bridge from that observable: one representative live state per
  generator class, plus the already-proved
  `illegalCount <= forcedStableCount_orbit` lower bound at `p2`. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so follow-on work can refine collapse time or strengthen the
  Hecke bridge without restating the current theorem boundary.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda` to connect
  the normalized same-fibre prefix branch and the normalized mixed-scale
  branch into one higher-level generator taxonomy: prefix classes keep
  explicit fourth-step shape labels, while mixed-scale classes keep their own
  normalized trajectory families. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so follow-on work can
  extend one taxonomy instead of growing parallel normalized branches.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMixedScaleTrajectoryFamily.agda`
  to package the mixed-scale trajectory branch into one normalized
  generator-class surface above the same-fibre prefixes: the dense support
  cascade is now the canonical stay-then-exit family, while the full-support
  cascade is the canonical immediate-exit family. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so future work can extend the mixed-scale branch through one
  shared surface instead of treating the two cascade modules as isolated
  trajectory facts.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda`
  from a single fourth-step exit witness into a reusable classifier above the
  normalized generator-class surface: anchored trajectory and explicit
  width-two now certify exits, balanced explicit/composed cycles certify
  exits into the anchored branch, and explicit width-three plus dense
  composed certify one more same-fibre live step. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so future work can extend certified boundaries instead of
  reburying fourth-step behavior inside one trajectory module.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTrajectoryCompositionFamily.agda`
  to package the successful same-carrier 3-state prefixes into one normalized
  generator-class interface: explicit cyclic, balanced cyclic, dense
  composed, balanced composed, and anchored trajectory. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search step can quantify over the shared
  generator surface instead of adding more one-off 3-state modules.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractBalancedComposedFamily.agda` to
  absorb the concrete balanced 3-cycle into the composed-generator lane:
  starting from `fullSupport`, vary one cut mask and one neg-restore mask,
  and the ternary interaction reconstructs the balanced tail cycle exactly.
  Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search target is framed as a new trajectory or
  composition class above the current explicit and first composed families.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadic3CycleInstance.agda` as the
  first fully concrete balanced 3-cycle inhabitant on the live
  `ShiftContractState` carrier: with head fixed at `pos`, the tail cycle
  `(pos , zer , neg) -> (zer , neg , pos) -> (neg , pos , zer)` preserves
  `π-mdl-max` and still splits pairwise at the transported prime image. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next generator search can treat balanced cyclic
  order as a landed same-carrier witness rather than just a design heuristic.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractComposedFamily.agda` as the first
  genuinely compositional same-carrier generator on `ShiftContractState`: a
  ternary interaction rule over base/cut/restore states that already recovers
  the dense width-three cyclic branch exactly. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next generator search is phrased as “go beyond the
  current hand-written and first composed finite families,” not merely “add
  another explicit cyclic witness.”
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStateFamily.agda` as the normalized
  same-carrier family-spec surface on the live `ShiftContractState` carrier:
  generic family record, cyclic-3 specialization, and canonical cyclic
  instances at support widths 1, 2, and 3. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so subsequent generator work can target the shared family
  schema instead of adding ad hoc cyclic witnesses only.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTriadicFamily.agda` to
  normalize the positive explicit cyclic branch on the noncanonical seam into
  one width-indexed surface over support widths 1, 2, and 3. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractFullSupportTrajectory.agda` as a
  distinct seed surface above that branch: the full-support state cascades
  `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1` under the live shift step. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is phrased in terms of new
  generators rather than more local support-width refinements.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractSupportCascadeTrajectory.agda` as
  the first mixed-scale live trajectory on the noncanonical seam: a dense
  seed gives one same-fibre width-three step and then exits through the
  anchored and one-hot fibres as the live dynamics contracts support width
  from 3 to 2 to 1. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is no longer “maybe try
  mixed-scale,” but “go beyond the current explicit cyclic, trajectory, and
  first mixed-scale cascade families.”
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractDenseTriadicFamily.agda` to extend
  the positive explicit-source branch on the noncanonical seam again:
  support width three now also admits a same-carrier triadic family with
  constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next search boundary is phrased as “go beyond the
  current explicit cyclic/trajectory families,” with explicit cyclic support
  now known at widths 1, 2, and 3.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTailPatternTrajectoryObstruction.agda`
  to close the obvious negative live-step branch on the noncanonical seam:
  the direct neg/pos tail-sign seeds leave the `π-mdl-max` fibre immediately
  under the live shift step. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` so the next noncanonical search stays focused on genuinely new
  cyclic, trajectory, or mixed-scale sources rather than retrying the direct
  tail-pattern seeds.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTrajectoryFamily.agda` as
  the first live-step family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState` seam:
  the anchored support-width-two source now yields a three-state trajectory
  prefix with constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime
  images, and the next live step exits that fibre by collapsing to the one-hot
  fixed point. Sync `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to record the corrected boundary: the next noncanonical search
  should go beyond the current explicit cyclic and first trajectory families,
  not merely beyond the one-hot/anchored static families.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTriadicFamily.agda` as the
  second genuine same-carrier family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState`
  seam: keep the coarse head fixed at `pos` and rotate a second active tail
  coordinate. The resulting support-width-two triad still has constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and
  `TODO.md` to record the corrected boundary: the next noncanonical search is
  no longer "go beyond the one-hot triad", but "go beyond the current explicit
  cyclic families" on the same carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadicFamily.agda` to package the
  first genuine same-carrier family on the noncanonical `ShiftContractState`
  seam: the three one-hot states form a triadic family with constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images. Sync
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and `TODO.md` to record the corrected
  boundary: one-hot states are not globally exhausted, only pairwise one-hot
  probes were; the next task is now to go beyond the landed one-hot triad
  rather than to exclude one-hot support categorically.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` again to sharpen the same noncanonical boundary:
  the next `ShiftContractState` family search is now constrained explicitly by
  the current audits. The repo now records that any viable same-carrier family
  should stay inside one `π-mdl-max` fibre, vary in
  `ker(π-mdl-max) \\ ker(primeImage)`, avoid one-hot/direct-tail and simple
  pair-generated constructions, and most plausibly appear first as a triadic
  or cyclic family rather than another reflection-level probe.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to reflect the new noncanonical boundary cleanly:
  the current `ShiftContractState` seam is no longer a nearby widening
  problem. The bounded same-carrier pools and the immediate
  `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback are now documented as exhausted or blocked,
  so the next honest step is a new same-carrier family/source generator rather
  than more small explicit perturbations or another representation-level lift.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseObservable.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibre.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalMdlP2Control.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowP2ControlCandidate.agda` to
  normalize the next noncanonical control step above the old `π-max`
  obstruction. The repo now packages `mdlLevel × π-max` as a reusable
  noncanonical observable/fibre surface, packages the corresponding narrow
  `p2` control-shape without overstating a positive inhabitant, and packages
  the `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback similarly. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so
  the next step is stated as a positive theorem attempt on `mdlLevel × π-max`,
  not another search for a stronger package.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibreFields.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelP2ControlAttempt.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelCounterexampleAudit.agda` to
  strengthen that same noncanonical mdl-level lane: the stronger surface now
  has its own fibre-field vocabulary, a first narrow positive theorem
  (package equality determines both `mdlLevel` and the old coarse observable),
  and an explicit audit that the original coarse counterexample pair is no
  longer the active blocker there. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` so
  the next gap is stated as finding the new witness or the first genuine
  prime-image/orbit-summary control theorem on `mdlLevel × π-max`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeOrOrbitControl.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelNewWitnessSearch.agda` as
  the next refinement pass on that same surface: no genuine prime-image
  control theorem is landed yet, but the first normalized intermediate theorem
  now exists on the mdl-level fibre, namely that prime equality already
  forces equality of the `p2` orbit-summary coordinate. The bounded witness
  search also records that the retired old coarse pair does not reappear as a
  blocker on this stronger surface. Sync docs/TODO/context so the next gap is
  stated specifically as prime-image control on `mdlLevel × π-max`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelP2PrimeBridge.agda` to
  strengthen that intermediate mdl-level bridge: prime equality on the
  strengthened fibre now explicitly carries the full orbit-summary coordinate
  family along with the already-landed `p2` orbit-summary equality. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyAttempt.agda`
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelChi2WitnessAudit.agda`:
  the first gives an honest singleton-subfamily prime-image theorem, while
  the second records that the current chi2 witness pool lives on the wrong
  carrier for this seam. Sync docs/TODO/context so the remaining gap is still
  prime-image control beyond that trivial subfamily, not summary-level
  consequences once prime equality is known.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSearchAudit.agda`
  to package the bounded same-carrier search state on the strengthened
  `mdlLevel × π-max` surface. The repo now records explicitly that, among the
  current in-repo `ShiftContractState` witnesses, the old coarse pair is
  retired, the certified prime-image subfamily remains the singleton around
  `coarseCounterexampleLeft`, and no fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` /
  unequal-prime-image pair has yet been recovered. Sync
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, `TODO.md`, and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
  so the next step stays focused on prime-image control beyond that bounded
  search scope.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyRefinement.agda`
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSourceAudit.agda`
  to sharpen that same mdl-level boundary without overstating a new control
  theorem. The first wraps the current in-tree witness set into an explicit
  two-point family where the same-state cases are stable and the mixed case is
  already rejected at `π-mdl-max`; the second packages the retired pair,
  singleton subfamily, and bounded search wrappers as an exhausted witness
  source boundary. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda`
  to turn the prepared `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback into a theorem-bearing
  obstruction: even that stronger normalized surface still does not determine
  the canonical `p2` orbit-summary key. Sync docs/TODO/context so the next
  step remains prime-image control beyond the exhausted mdl-level pools, with
  the fallback branch now explicitly obstructed at the canonical `p2` seam.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMdlLevelExplicitStateSearchAudit.agda`
  to close the obvious direct explicit-state pool on actual
  `ShiftContractState`: the retired coarse pair, one-hot states, and direct
  neg/pos tail patterns are now all recorded as checked without yielding a
  fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` / unequal-prime-image witness. Also add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda`
  to package the higher fallback as a direct no-go control schema: any attempt
  to recover the canonical `p2` orbit-summary from normalized
  `eigenShadow × π-max` equality collapses on the CP/CC witness pair. Sync
  docs/TODO/context so the next step is now clearly “find a genuinely new
  same-carrier family or leave the current fallback ladder,” not “retest the
  obvious pools.”
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`,
  `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  and `TODO.md` to record the stricter closure target and observable split that
  emerged from the current bridge/obstruction results:
  closure now means one carrier, one admissible law, one observable package,
  one RG/coarse-graining story, and one conserved/defect interpretation with
  no unresolved bridge theorem between them. The docs now also state the
  current canonical boundary explicitly:
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` is the strongest landed
  closure→schedule bridge quotient, while bridge-level `mdlLevel`,
  bridge-level `eigenShadow`, raw `eigenSummary`, and raw `heckeSignature`
  remain non-descending on `CP`; these are now documented explicitly as
  fibre/defect data rather than left as undifferentiated failed widenings.
- extend the same docs/TODO pass with the next formalization target for that
  split: define the thin closure fibre over
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, lift Hecke/eigen channels to
  fibre-indexed fields, and target histogram/defect-controlled fibre laws
  before any stronger factorization claim.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibre.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreFields.agda` as the first
  concrete canonical fibre layer over the coarse quotient
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`; the repo now re-exposes raw Hecke/eigen
  channels as fibre-indexed fields and proves the first canonical control law:
  transported illegal/forced-stable counts are constant for fibre
  representatives that agree on the exact pair chamber of the prime-address
  carrier. Sync `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`, and
  `TODO.md` to record that the next remaining gap is richer
  defect-profile/histogram factorization on those fibres.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreDefectFactorization.agda`
  as the next canonical fibre-law layer: the canonical fibre now carries
  explicit defect-profile, histogram, and orbit-summary fields over the
  transported prime representative. Land the first honest richer-control
  theorems there: illegal chamber entries force stable/zero-drift profile
  behaviour, and the fibre-side forced-stable count is bounded above by the
  orbit-summary stable count. Update docs/TODO so the next remaining gap is
  control/factorization of the actual Hecke/eigen fibre fields, not merely
  their count projections.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreEigenShadowObstruction.agda`
  and record the stronger closure-side classification result it gives:
  `eigenShadow` is not only blocked as a closure→schedule bridge channel, it
  already varies inside the canonical coarse fibre
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` itself. Sync docs/TODO so the next move is
  to control that variation via the landed defect-profile/orbit-summary
  carriers rather than to keep treating `eigenShadow` as a candidate
  descending observable.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda`
  as the first positive control result after that obstruction:
  the richer orbit-summary family already detects the same-fibre `CR`/`CP`
  variation that witnesses `eigenShadow` as genuine fibre data, and the
  single `p2` orbit-summary coordinate already suffices. Update docs/TODO to
  reflect the narrower remaining gap: move from concrete detection to a more
  structural factorization/control theorem.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureCoarseObservable.agda` to turn
  the current canonical boundary into a theorem-bearing module: formalize
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` as the maximal currently bridged coarse
  observable package, factor it through the landed motif-level
  closure→schedule bridge, and package obstruction-facing wrappers for the
  wider bridge shapes that still fail on `CP`.
- strengthen
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda` from
  witness-only separation to a universal canonical-fibre control theorem:
  equality of the `p2` orbit-summary coordinate now forces equality of
  `eigenShadowField` on the canonical coarse fibre. Sync docs/TODO so `p2`
  is now tracked as a genuine control surface on that carrier rather than
  only a diagnostic witness.
- add
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  as the first broader noncanonical replay of the observable-transport plus
  prime-compatibility tower on full `ShiftContractState`, recovering the
  witness-level bridge and `illegalCount-chamber ≤ forcedStableCount-hist`
  surface on a larger carrier without changing the current honesty boundary.
- strengthen
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda`
  again by packaging the canonical `p2` control theorem as an explicit
  quotient-facing factor-law surface
  (`P2EigenShadowFactorLaw`, `canonicalP2EigenShadowFactorLaw`) and by
  proving the parallel Hecke-side control theorem
  `p2-controls-hecke-on-canonical-fibre`.
- extend the same canonical fibre-control module with the explicit Hecke
  factor-law packaging
  (`P2HeckeFactorLaw`, `canonicalP2HeckeFactorLaw`) so the existing `p2`
  Hecke control is now surfaced as a quotient-facing record as well.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseObservable.agda` to replay the
  coarse package itself on full `ShiftContractState`: the broader carrier now
  has its own `π-max` into `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, and that
  projection factors through both the observable-transport witness and the
  noncanonical bundle observable surface. Sync docs/TODO/context to reflect
  that the remaining gap has moved from coarse packaging to lifting the
  fibre-control story noncanonically.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseFibre.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCoarseFibreFields.agda` as the first
  noncanonical fibre vocabulary over that broader coarse package: the repo now
  exposes a thin `ShiftContractState` fibre over
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` together with the corresponding
  Hecke/eigen/prime/count/orbit-summary field surface. The remaining
  noncanonical gap is therefore theorem-bearing control, not missing fibre
  carriers or field names.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlObstruction.agda`
  to sharpen that noncanonical gap: the current broader coarse package is
  already too weak for a canonical-style `p2` factor/control law, because two
  explicit `ShiftContractState` values share the same `π-max` image while
  splitting at the transported prime image. The next noncanonical positive
  attempt therefore has to strengthen the invariant package rather than reuse
  the canonical recipe unchanged.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlMdlLevelObstruction.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractEigenShadowNormalizedPackage.agda`, and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractRGObservableProjection.agda` as the next
  candidate-search round above that obstruction: the cheapest aligned
  strengthening `mdlLevel × π-max` already separates the current obstruction
  pair, `eigenShadow × π-max` does too, and the full normalized shift RG
  observable also separates the pair through the Hecke-signature side. This
  promotes `mdlLevel × π-max` to the next honest starting point for a
  noncanonical control theorem.

## 2026-04-01

- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureShiftScheduleBridge.agda`
  with the first honest canonical closure→schedule bridge on a nontrivial
  quotient, namely `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`; also record that the
  larger projected-charge bridge
  `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow` is obstructed on
  the canonical `CP` branch. Sync the reporter-boundary wording in
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, and
  `TODO.md`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalClosureShiftScheduleBridge.agda` and
  sharpen the schedule-bridge roadmap in `TODO.md` plus
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`: the minimal transported
  closure→shift schedule surface is now explicit, and the stronger raw-eigen
  closure/schedule bridge shape is now proved obstructed on the canonical
  `CP` branch.
- add `canonicalEigenLevel-CP-obstructed` to
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, making
  the canonical raw-`eigenSummary` obstruction proof-bearing rather than only
  narrative; this sharpens the current AGMB boundary that
  `eigenShadow = (earth , hub)` is the strongest landed closure-honest
  quotient on the tiny `CR/CP/CC` carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the bundle-level
  `ObservableTransportWitness` lift is now exercised concretely on the
  canonical abstract gauge/matter bundle carrier, via
  `canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
- repair the canonical AGMB continuum lane in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda` by making
  `ContinuumWitness` preserve a projected continuum observable rather than the
  full transported `RGObservable`; the canonical instance now compiles again
  with the closure-honest target
  `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow`, where
  `eigenShadow = (earth , hub)` is the first nontrivial preserved quotient of
  `eigenSummary`, while the stronger
  full-observable target remains explicitly blocked on the `CP` branch.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStatePrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the transported-profile route now
  also has a full execution-contract carrier instance:
  `EC.Contract.State (shiftContract {1}{3})` now instantiates both
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist` and the orbit-side
  forced-stable bridge through
  `canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftGeoVPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the transported-profile route now
  has a genuinely broader concrete carrier: the full `ShiftGeoV` state family
  now instantiates both the witness-level inequality
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`
  and the orbit-side forced-stable bridge, rather than only the tiny canonical
  `CR/CP/CC` carrier.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalTransportedPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so the generic transported-profile
  constructor is now exercised concretely on the canonical carrier and shown to
  agree with the closure-native `CR/CP/CC` prime embedding.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda`
  and extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so bundle-level closure carriers can
  now inherit the minimal witness bridge whenever they already export an
  `ObservableTransportWitness` and a target-side prime embedding.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TransportedPrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda` and
  extend the Hecke bridge docs/TODO so any closure family with a transported
  `State -> FactorVec` image can now recover the same witness-level bridge
  surface by forgetting multiplicity and keeping only prime-lane presence.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PrimeCompatibilityProfile.agda` and refactor
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalChamberToShiftWitnessBridgeInstance.agda`
  through it, so closure-native compatibility data now has a reusable path to
  prime embeddings, illegal masks, and witness-level forced-stable bridges
  instead of being wired only as a one-off canonical table.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalChamberToShiftWitnessBridgeInstance.agda`
  and extend `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the smaller witness-level
  bridge now has a first concrete canonical inhabitant. This gives a real
  canonical proof of `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`, and it
  now computes the compatibility mask from a closure-native profile on the
  three-generator canonical carrier, with the transported shift image retained
  only as an audit equality.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ChamberToShiftWitnessBridge.agda` and extend
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the repo now has the minimal fixed-prime witness bridge:
  closure-side illegal mask,
  shift-side forced-stable witness mask,
  and the aggregate theorem
  `illegalCount-chamber <= forcedStableCount-hist`
  derived from pointwise witness soundness.
- weaken `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` ContinuumWitness
  by removing `scaleFromCarrier` and preservation laws, and adjust
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  accordingly. Docs/TODO now reflect that the canonical AGMB instance compiles
  under the weaker continuum surface; stronger continuum targets remain
  blocked because the current closure-derived law does not preserve
  `canonicalRGObservableOf` on the `CP` branch.
- add `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalForcedStableTransferBridgeInstance.agda`
  and extend `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`,
  `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and `TODO.md` so the forced-stable bridge
  ladder now has a first concrete canonical inhabitant using the existing map
  `canonicalTransportState -> canonicalShiftHeckeState -> shiftPrimeEmbedding`.
  This instantiates the orbit-side inequality on the canonical closure carrier,
  but the chamber count is still defined from the transported shift image, so
  the bridge is concrete without yet being closure-native.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableTransferBridge.agda` and update
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`, `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, and
  `TODO.md` so the current bridge ladder is now explicit code rather than only
  a note:
  exact-chamber illegal-count constancy,
  an abstract closure-to-shift lower bound
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`,
  and the derived composed bound
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_orbit`.
  The closure-to-shift bridge map itself is still not inhabited.
- update `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `TODO.md`, and `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md`
  after the refreshed pull of archived thread `Dashi and Physics Insights` to
  record the current bridge-sequencing target as
  `illegalCount_chamber ≤ forcedStableCount_hist ≤ forcedStableCount_orbit`, with
  `S(x)` the closure→shift transport image and a preferred first goal of
  `illegalCount_chamber(x,p) ≤ forcedStableCount_hist(S(x),p)`.
- add a reminder that the physics-facing story must stay on the representation
  layer until the canonical closure-to-shift schedule bridge is proven and the
  raw `heckeSignature`/`eigenSummary` obstructions are resolved; this keeps
  reporter claims grounded in the formal inequality ladder rather than an
  unproven conserved observable.

## 2026-03-31

- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectProfileCorrespondence.agda` and
  extend `Docs/HeckeDefectProfileCorrespondence.md` so the chamber-side
  illegal-mode restriction now lifts from coarse defect classes to the full
  defect-profile correspondence: illegal entries are forced to have zero
  signature drift, fixed motif, and `Stable` coarse defect throughout an exact
  chamber.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecOrbitForcedStableLowerBound.agda` and extend
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md` so the first orbit-summary component is
  now constrained honestly: the histogram-layer forced-stable / illegal count
  is a lower bound for the orbit-summary `forcedStableCount` field, because
  illegal entries are always Stable at the full defect-profile level even
  though not every Stable profile entry is forced by illegality.
- update `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`, and `TODO.md` to pin down the
  current eigen-side widening blocker more precisely: the live
  `shiftEigenSchedule` theorem exists only on the shift carrier, and there is
  still no canonical closure-to-shift schedule bridge from the closure-derived
  law `x ↦ [ CR , x ]` into that live schedule.
- update `Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to record the current full Hecke-side stack more
  accurately:
  exact legality-signature chambers are already landed locally, while
  compressed chamber quotients, orbit families, correspondence algebra,
  weighted operators, spectral structure, and any bridge to the contractive
  physics bundle remain open. The next explicit Hecke-side target is now
  histogram-level chamber stability on the defect correspondence fiber rather
  than another abstract transport surface.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectHistograms.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectHistograms.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeDefectHistograms.md` as the first histogram layer above the
  15-entry defect correspondence fiber; the repo now extracts full
  defect-class histograms and proves chamber-stability for the forced-stable /
  illegal count, without yet claiming that the full histogram is chamber
  invariant.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecHistogramObstruction.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeDefectHistogramObstruction.md` to record a concrete small
  counterexample showing that the full defect histogram is not determined by
  the exact legality-signature data alone; the forced-stable / illegal count
  remains the strongest proved chamber-invariant histogram component.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectOrbitSummaries.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeDefectOrbitSummaries.md` as the first orbit-style summary layer
  above the full defect-profile correspondence, compressing each target-prime
  fiber to drift, motif-change, and coarse defect-count statistics without yet
  claiming chamber or transport invariance for that summary carrier.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda` to record that
  the first orbit-style summary layer is also not determined by legality-
  signature data alone; the current counterexample already separates the full
  orbit summary on the same small `p7 = 2` versus `p7 = 3` family.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/ReverseRepresentation.agda` plus
  `Docs/ReverseHeckeRepresentation.md` as the first local implementation of
  the archived reverse-Hecke idea, explicitly on the representation layer and
  not in the contractive conserved-witness bundle.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/QuotientRepresentation.agda` plus
  `Docs/HeckeQuotientRepresentation.md` as the first local equivalence/setoid
  and quotient-facing Hecke interface, again on the representation layer and
  not in the contractive closure bundle.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecInstances.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecHeckeInstance.md` as the first concrete representation-layer
  Hecke inhabitant on the existing 15-prime factor-vector carrier.
- strengthen that first concrete `FactorVec` inhabitant with a genuinely
  coarser quotient carrier, `SupportMask`, so the representation-layer Hecke
  path now has more than the trivial equality quotient.
- strengthen the same `FactorVec` inhabitant again with a richer alternate
  transport family, `flowPrime`, which acts on the selected prime lane and the
  next prime lane in the fixed Monster ordering.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SignedTransport.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecSignedTransport.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecSignedTransport.md` as the first signed multi-lane transport
  law on the prime-address carrier, with explicit legality and a fine
  equality-quotient descended action.
- clarify that the signed `FactorVec` transport still does not descend to a
  finite coarse multiplicity quotient, so the current strongest honest
  statement remains: exact signed transport descends on the fine equality
  quotient but not on the coarser support-style quotients.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/SignedTransportObstruction.agda` as a concrete
  counterexample module showing that support-mask equivalence is not preserved
  by the signed decrement-plus-increment transport.
- strengthen that obstruction module with a general proof that positive bounded
  saturation quotients of the form `e ↦ min(e, K)` also fail to respect the
  signed decrement-plus-increment transport.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecSignedScan.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecSignedScan.md` to attach the signed transport family to the
  existing Hecke scan and motif pipeline surfaces on the representation layer.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/MultiLaneSignedTransport.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneTransport.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecMultiLaneTransport.md` as the first reusable mode-labelled
  multi-lane signed-transport interface and concrete `FactorVec` inhabitant.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/TransportChambers.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecTransportChambers.agda`, and
  `Docs/FactorVecTransportChambers.md` as the first exact chamber surface for
  the multi-lane `FactorVec` transport stack, using full `PairMode` legality
  signatures rather than an overcompressed threshold quotient.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.md` as the first pre/post signed-scan defect
  layer for the multi-lane `FactorVec` transport stack, classifying
  scan-visible behavior into `Stable`, `Repatterning`, `Contractive`, and
  `Expansive`.
- strengthen `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecMultiLaneDefects.agda` with explicit
  illegal-mode stability lemmas, and add
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectRestrictions.agda` plus
  `Docs/FactorVecChamberDefectRestrictions.md` as the first theorem bridge
  from exact chamber agreement to defect behavior: illegal modes force
  `Stable` defects throughout an exact chamber.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/CorrespondenceRepresentation.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecCorrespondence.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeCorrespondenceRepresentation.md` as the first genuine finite
  correspondence-class Hecke operator on the representation layer, with a
  true sum-over-fiber action on the `SupportMask` quotient carrier.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/DefectCorrespondenceRepresentation.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectCorrespondence.agda`, and
  `Docs/HeckeDefectCorrespondence.md` as the first scan/defect-derived finite
  correspondence family and averaging operator on the representation layer.
- add `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecDefectProfileCorrespondence.agda`,
  `Ontology/Hecke/FactorVecChamberDefectCorrespondence.agda`,
  `Docs/HeckeDefectProfileCorrespondence.md`, and
  `Docs/HeckeChamberDefectCorrespondence.md` to lift the defect-derived
  correspondence from coarse defect classes to full finite profiles and to
  state the first chamber-side restriction directly on correspondence entries.
- add `Ontology/DNA/Supervoxel4Adic.agda`,
  `Ontology/DNA/ChemistryQuotient.agda`, and
  `Docs/DNASupervoxelHierarchy.md` to start a local DNA-first 4-adic
  supervoxel lane with a chemistry-visible quotient surface on `DNA256`.
- add `Ontology/DNA/ChemistryConcrete.agda` as the first concrete chemistry
  quotient instance on `DNA256`, with a `U/V` feature map, strong-base thermo
  count, and local immediate repeat/complement admissibility screen.
- strengthen that concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance with a bounded
  nonlocal complement rule at span 2, so the thermo/admissibility surface is
  no longer purely nearest-neighbor.
- strengthen the same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 4-window GC-extremal ban, so the admissibility screen now includes a
  first local GC-balance constraint in addition to repeat/complement checks.
- strengthen that same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 4-window reverse-complement palindrome ban, so the admissibility and
  thermo surfaces now include a first explicitly DNA-specific reverse-
  complement screen beyond the earlier span-2 rule.
- strengthen that same concrete `DNA256` chemistry instance again with a
  sliding 6-window hairpin-style reverse-complement screen, so the bounded
  thermo surface now includes a first explicitly hairpin-flavored local law.
- add `Docs/PhysicsArchiveCoverageMap.md` and update
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` with the current local-DB archive coverage map for
  the physics-closure program, including canonical thread metadata and the
  current repo-facing priority order:
  derived dynamics law,
  realization-independent projection/delta theorem,
  signature forcing / execution-delta interface,
  continuum scaling law,
  then the physical reality bridge from wavefield / phase synchronization.
- update `README.md` and `TODO.md` so the same archive-backed lane split is
  now explicit in public status and roadmap files, with the light-transport /
  phase-sync material treated as P1 support work and moonshine-adjacent
  material kept off the critical physics path unless it directly reduces a P0
  proof gap.
- strengthen the abstract recovery theorem surface again by making transported
  projection/Δ compatibility part of `GaugeMatterRecoveryTheorem` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`; the canonical bundle
  inhabitant now supplies that proof payload directly, and the surrounding
  bundle/gap docs and TODOs now record that this seam is no longer only a
  parallel export.
- strengthen that same recovery theorem surface again so it now carries both
  the base and alternate transported projection/Δ schedule families rather
  than only one target-side family; the canonical bundle instance exports both
  through recovery-level conversion helpers.

## 2026-03-30

- add a second live-shift inhabitant of the reusable
  `TransportedProjectionDeltaWitness` surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, covering
  the alternate phase schedule pair
  (`shiftCoarseAlt ∘ step`, `step ∘ shiftCoarseAlt`) alongside the original
  base pair.
- generalize the new target-side projection/Δ lane into a reusable bundle-layer
  theorem surface by adding `TransportedProjectionDeltaWitness` plus
  `toTransportedProjectionDeltaCompatibility` in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`; the canonical
  shift-target witness now inhabits that generic surface.
- add a first transport-attached target-side projection/Δ witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`, so the
  canonical bundle now exports the live shift carrier schedules
  (`shiftCoarse ∘ step`, `shiftCoarseAlt`) and cone transport lemmas through
  the existing observable transport layer.
- strengthen the canonical bundle-side projection/Δ lane in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda` with a
  second, quotient-sensitive witness over the transported live
  `RGObservable`, reusing the shift RG lane’s `Observable≈` quotient instead
  of only plain equality on the full bundle observable.
- lift the new `ProjectionDeltaCompatibility` surface into
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda` by extending
  `NaturalDynamicsWitness` with offset admissibility/cone preservation and
  exporting `toProjectionDeltaCompatibility`; the canonical bundle instance
  now exposes `canonicalBundleProjectionDeltaCompatibility`.
- add an explicit projection/delta abstraction surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/RGObservableInvariance.agda` as
  `ProjectionDeltaCompatibility`, then instantiate it from the live shift RG
  schedules in `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda` so the
  projection/Δ lane is no longer only a documentation target.
- strengthen `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  so the canonical bundle's `mdlLevel` is no longer a constant-zero placeholder
  but is instead read from the transported live `RGObservable` imported from
  `shiftRGSurface`; keep the cone witness intentionally trivial at this layer
  because the current carrier dynamics is still synthetic and does not yet
  justify a shift-derived cone-preservation theorem.
- replace the synthetic three-cycle in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first closure-derived carrier law, namely the canonical bracket
  action `x ↦ [ CR , x ]`; this keeps the bundle nontrivial while tying the
  dynamics to the actual canonical closure package rather than a hand-chosen
  carrier permutation.
- strengthen that same canonical abstract bundle instance again so the
  conserved witness is no longer gauge-only but now carries the first stable
  transported RG payload under the closure-derived law:
  `Gauge × mdlLevel × motifClass`.
- strengthen the abstract continuum lane so `ContinuumWitness` now carries an
  explicit limit carrier, scaling map, limit-side MDL readout, and limit-side
  cone witness rather than only a bare `limitObservable`; inhabit that stronger
  surface canonically in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`.
- connect the already-landed offset-universality abstraction back into the
  abstract bundle layer by exporting `GaugeMatterRecoveryTheorem` as an
  `ObservableRGOffsetUniversality` witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`, and expose that
  converted witness from the canonical abstract bundle instance.
- strengthen the canonical continuum inhabitant again so its limit carrier is
  now the transported `RGObservable` rather than the whole
  `Gauge × RGObservable` field; the first continuum scaling law therefore
  quotients away the gauge wrapper instead of merely rewrapping the same
  finite bundle object.
- update `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md`, `Docs/ContinuumLimit.md`,
  `Docs/GaugeMatterCapstone.md`, and `TODO.md` so the next promotion
  gates are explicit: possible widening beyond the current conserved
  `mdlLevel`/`motifClass` witness, bundle-level integration of the already-
  landed offset-universality surface, and a less finite/repackaged continuum
  carrier/scaling law.
- added the moonshine-primes proof-planning stack:
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeNullModels.md`,
  `Docs/CarrierFactorization.md`,
  `Docs/CanonicalPrimeSelectionLaw.md`,
  `Docs/MoonshineMatch.md`,
  `Docs/PrimeToModular.md`,
  and `Docs/MoonshineProofChecklist.md`,
  so the repo now has a staged proof program with definitions, null tests,
  carrier hypotheses, legal Monster-comparison forms, and explicit promotion
  gates.
- tightened `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md` with the executable schema contract
  for the first implementation surface:
  accepted JSON fields, normalized quotient output, and the exact observable
  summary needed before null models or prime-selection tests can run.
- added `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md` and cleaned
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md` so the physics-gap story now matches the
  repo:
  execution, basin, cone, and signature surfaces already exist, but several
  of the strongest witnesses remain canonical-only or partially trivialized,
  with the highest-priority gap now stated as the execution/eigen bridge into
  the abstract bundle layer.
- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftExecutionInvariantCore.agda` as a shared
  shift-side invariant core:
  it computes the canonical shift Hecke/signature/eigen payload below both the
  execution and RG layers so execution-side eigen witnesses no longer have to
  stay at the constant-zero placeholder level.
- strengthened
  `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda` so the canonical `(1,3)`
  execution contract now uses that shared core for its eigen witness and keeps
  the noncanonical fallback branch explicitly trivial rather than implicitly
  pretending to carry the same proof mass.
- extended
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`
  with `SignatureLockWitness`, and strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  so the canonical bundle inhabitant now carries:
  - a shift-derived canonical signature/eigen payload from the shared core,
  - and a `sig31`-locked signature witness on the abstract bundle surface.
- revalidated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda` on its own
  theorem path after making the canonical basin transport explicit, then
  replaced the synthetic RG payload in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the observed value of the live `shiftRGSurface` at
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness`, so the abstract bundle now carries a real
  anchor-state import from the shift RG surface rather than a locally
  manufactured placeholder observable.
- extended
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.agda`
  with `ObservableTransportWitness` and strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first carrier-level observable transport inhabitant:
  the canonical bundle now transports every carrier point into an external
  shift-RG target carrier and proves admissible-state soundness of that
  transport, while still keeping the target-side map explicitly constant at
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness`.
- strengthened that first transport inhabitant further:
  the canonical observable transport now factors through the concrete
  three-generator carrier (`CR`, `CP`, `CC`) and chooses among three
  shift-side representatives.
- tightened the canonical bundle observable layer so it now follows the
  transported shift state itself rather than carrying one fixed RG payload:
  the abstract bundle transport is therefore sensitive at the
  `RGObservable` level, while the surrounding canonical bundle dynamics remain
  the minimal identity dynamics.
- replaced those identity bundle dynamics in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalAbstractGaugeMatterInstance.agda`
  with the first non-identity carrier law on the concrete canonical carrier:
  a three-cycle `CR -> CP -> CC -> CR`, while narrowing the conserved witness
  to the gauge charge and letting the transported RG observable vary with the
  chosen shift-side target.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_object.py` as the first executable schema for
  the moonshine-primes program:
  it parses one `MoonshinePrimeState` JSON payload and emits the normalized
  quotient object (`factorSupport`, support weight, signature, eigen summary,
  basin label, and denominator fields) required by the later null-model and
  prime-selection lanes.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_nulls.py` as the first executable null-model
  harness for the moonshine-primes program:
  it runs schema-level random-partition, ternary-state, matched-support, and
  randomized-rotation controls, computes empirical `p`-values, and emits the
  stop-rule verdict needed before any Monster comparison logic.
- tightened the next grounding step for that program:
  the moonshine-prime schema should now be attached to a repo-native emitted
  state source (starting with the canonical shift example JSONs) before the
  null-model lane is widened further.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_prototype.py` to adapt the canonical
  emitted prototype states into `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads, and validated
  the full path on `scripts/examples/near_miss_state.json`; on that grounded
  example the target-prime support is empty (`47,59,71` absent), so the
  null-model stop rule remains triggered as it should.
- added `Docs/MoonshinePrimeSource.md` to separate the moonshine-prime program
  from the photonuclear lane and name the first repo-native source-family
  candidates under `DASHI/Physics/Moonshine`.
- fixed the first moonshine-native adapter boundary in
  `Docs/MoonshinePrimeSource.md`:
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda` can first be consumed as an
  orientation-prime source before any stronger fixed-count trace extraction is
  claimed.
- tightened that moonshine-native source contract further:
  the first executable adapter is explicitly restricted to an
  `orientation_prime_only` state lifted from
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda`, with provenance but without any invented
  full-trace or modular semantics.
- added `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` as the first
  moonshine-native adapter:
  it extracts the explicit `just 31` orientation hook from
  `FiniteTwinedShellTraceShift.agda`, emits a minimal
  `MoonshinePrimeState` payload marked `orientation_prime_only`, and validates
  cleanly through `scripts/moonshine_prime_object.py` to the normalized
  quotient object with factor support `{31}`.
- tightened the next moonshine-native strengthening rule:
  richer finite-twined report/bundle fields may now be attached as auxiliary
  metadata, but they still must not silently alter the normalized
  moonshine-prime observable until a documented lift exists.
- strengthened `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` to attach
  auxiliary finite-twined report metadata drawn from
  `FiniteTwinedTraceDetailedReport.agda`,
  `MoonshineTraceFamilySummary.agda`,
  `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle.agda`, and
  `FiniteTwinerLibraryShift.agda`:
  the emitted state now carries explicit verdict-slot counts, extra-verdict
  counts, compared-twiner counts, and labeled shift twiner names under
  `traceReport` while the normalized observable remains conservatively pinned
  to factor support `{31}`.
- added the `P0` gauge/matter recovery documentation stack:
  `Docs/RealizationIndependence.md`,
  `Docs/NaturalDynamicsLaw.md`,
  `Docs/ConservedQuantities.md`,
  `Docs/ContinuumLimit.md`,
  `Docs/GaugeMatterCapstone.md`,
  and `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`,
  so the weakest physics block now has an explicit theorem/program breakdown
  and a named next implementation seam.
- clarified the first planned inhabitant of the abstract gauge/matter bundle:
  the current canonical constraint/gauge package lifted through identity
  dynamics with the gauge label treated as the first conserved observable.
- tightened the next follow-up on that bundle:
  the first strengthening should import the `RGObservable` surface as a minimal
  typed payload alongside the gauge label, rather than faking a shift-side RG
  computation on the canonical constraint carrier.
- narrowed that strengthening further:
  the first honest transported payload should come from the real shift RG
  surface evaluated at `canonicalShiftStateWitness`, making the lift
  anchor-state-based rather than purely synthetic.
- added `Docs/TriadicCarrierToSU3.md` to state the safe bridge from a triadic
  3-sector carrier to an `SU(3)`-like internal symmetry candidate, including
  the required extra assumptions (Hermitian norm preservation,
  determinant-one admissible mixing, observable quotient).
- added `Docs/MusicalSymmetryMDL.md` plus
  `scripts/musical_symmetry_mdl.py` to replace the earlier symmetry-reward toy
  target with the stronger MDL/compression basin target:
  contraction plus a compression proxy, without explicit symmetry reward.
- added `Docs/ColourInDashi.md` to make the colour-language claim boundary
  explicit:
  optical colour is treated as a projection-stable observable on a structured
  latent signal, perceptual colour is kept separate as an organized
  interpretation/reconstruction layer, and QCD colour is not collapsed into the
  same formal object.
- updated repo-facing context/docs so MDL reconstruction, ultrametric geometry,
  and cone-screened dynamics are described as internal Dashi structure on
  encoded colour states rather than as finished empirical theorems about human
  colour perception.
- added the photonuclear prototype documentation stack:
  `Docs/PhotonBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CMSPhotonuclearBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CharmPhotoproduction.md`,
  `Docs/SaturationLayer.md`,
  `Docs/CMSCapstone.md`,
  `Docs/NumericObservableInterface.md`,
  `Docs/GBWResponse.md`,
  `Docs/ModelComparison.md`,
  `Docs/PrototypeRunner.md`,
  and `Docs/PrototypeExamples.md`.
- added the first executable surrogate prototype surface:
  `scripts/prototype_schema.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_gbw.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_ipsat.py`,
  `scripts/prototype_runner.py`,
  `scripts/compare_prototype_channels.py`,
  and `scripts/compare_surrogate_models.py`.
- added hand-constructed example states for qualitative explanatory inspection:
  `scripts/examples/near_miss_state.json` and
  `scripts/examples/head_on_state.json`.
- added `scripts/prototype_matrix.py` as the first batch prediction matrix over
  example states and reduced model families, making the prototype compare
  channel-to-channel and model-to-model explanations without performing fitting
  or claiming empirical validation.
- replaced the prototype's freehand example-fixture plan with an emitted
  shift-path example plan:
  docs/TODO now anchor prototype example states to
  `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda::canonicalShiftStateWitness`
  and `ShiftInBasin`, and a dedicated emitter script materializes the example
  JSON files from that named provenance surface.
- taught the comparison/matrix runner layer to auto-refresh the canonical
  emitted example files when those documented example paths are missing or
  stale relative to `scripts/emit_shift_prototype_examples.py`.
- added a shared non-fitting explanation scorecard in
  `scripts/prototype_scorecard.py` and threaded it into the comparison/model
  inspection surfaces so “better explanation” is now defined in terms of
  normalized residual, MDL burden, and surrogate-confidence penalty rather
  than empirical fit claims.

## 2026-03-27

- recorded PR `#1` (`nix support`) as the active source merge target for the
  missing Agda surface in this checkout and documented the exact modules and
  perf wiring it contributes.
- merged the source-level Agda additions from that patchset into the local
  tree: `Kernel/KAlgebra.agda`, `Monster/MUltrametric.agda`, `Moonshine.agda`,
  `MoonshineEarn.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`, `PerfHistory.agda`, `perf_da51.py`,
  `agda_da51_source.jsonl`, `agda_da51_traces.jsonl`, and the related import
  rewrites.

## 2026-03-25

- added [`MONSTER10WALK_INTAKE.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/MONSTER10WALK_INTAKE.md)
  to pin the local source hierarchy for the Monster 10-walk thread:
  upstream `monster/experiments/bott_periodicity/monster_walk.tex` as the
  source table, plus sibling-repo
  `../FRACDASH/MONSTER10WALK_CANONICAL.md` and
  `../FRACDASH/JMD_HANDOFF_NOTE.md` as the current local executable
  interpretation and claim-boundary notes.
- updated [`fracdash-impl/README.md`](/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_agda/fracdash-impl/README.md)
  so the FRACDASH bridge note points directly at the new Monster 10-walk
  intake document instead of leaving that cross-repo dependency implicit.

## 2026-03-23

- added a local merge-prep Nix / zkperf tooling surface for upstream PR-style
  integration work:
  `flake.nix` now exposes an authoritative check that mirrors the existing
  GitHub CI route through `DASHI/Everything.agda`, a second recursive
  `merge-smoke` check for merge-relevant standalone roots plus recursive
  `Kernel/`, `Monster/`, and `Verification/` modules, and a dev shell with
  `agda-record` / `agda-record-all`.
- added `dashi-agda.agda-lib` as an explicit local library surface for that
  tooling.
- added `scripts/list_merge_agda_targets.sh` and
  `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh` so the recursive merge-prep target surface
  is explicit, deterministic, and reusable by both the smoke check and
  `agda-record-all`.
- documented the merge-policy decision that DA51 / zkperf JSONL demo artifacts
  are acceptable for now as illustrative witness outputs, but should be read
  as non-authoritative sample data rather than canonical reproducibility
  fixtures.
- validated the new local surface with:
  shell syntax checks for the helper scripts,
  deterministic target-list output,
  representative Agda checks on `ActionMonotonicity.agda` and
  `Monster/Projection.agda`,
  and one full successful run of `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh`
  covering `20` merge-smoke targets.
- generated `flake.lock` from the new merge-prep flake inputs and then fixed
  the first Nix-build failure:
  the original authoritative and merge-smoke derivations tried to let Agda
  write `_build/*.agdai` into the read-only Nix source tree, so the flake
  checks now stage the repo into a writable temp directory before typechecking.
  The flake also now uses `pkgs.perf` instead of the deprecated
  `linuxPackages.perf` alias.
- fixed the next authoritative Nix failure too:
  the derivation now provides a UTF-8 locale through `glibcLocales` and
  `LOCALE_ARCHIVE`/`LANG`/`LC_ALL`, so Agda's Unicode-bearing diagnostics no
  longer fail inside the Nix sandbox on modules such as
  `DASHI/Algebra/MonsterUltrametric15.agda`.
- closed out the merge-prep Nix / zkperf surface after a successful local
  `nix flake check`, `nix build .#check`, and `nix build .#merge-smoke` run
  on the locked flake; the merge-prep tooling is now considered complete and
  the repo returns to the physics closure priorities tracked in `TODO.md`.
- trimmed the canonical closure export surface by removing the legacy
  assumption-first closure instance from the public
  `PhysicsClosureSummary`/`Everything` path while keeping the compatibility
  module on disk, and dropped the empirical-to-full adapter from the umbrella
  import too; the outside-wired full-closure and provider-based constructors
  are now labeled as legacy adapters.
- routed `physicsClosureFullFromCoreWitness` directly from the core witness,
  removing the last canonical bounce through the legacy external adapter.
- routed the canonical contraction→quadratic theorem constructor through the
  strong package’s canonical identity witness, reducing duplicated split
  construction on the canonical path.
- promoted the remaining theorem-checklist / bridge-package seam to the
  direct core-witness route as a tracked follow-up, so the long-running
  closure-spine cleanup stays explicit in `TODO.md`.

## 2026-03-25

- recorded the SL ↔ DA51 ↔ Agda contract in `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` and
  `DASHI/HME/Trace.agda` so the proof layer only consumes `TraceWitness`,
  `CanonicalWitness`, and `ProofStatus` records without touching closure
  semantics.
- added `scripts/hme_pipeline.py` to normalize DA51 traces, compute entropy/MDL
  proxies, score cone similarity against multi-attractor candidates, cluster via
  k-means, and measure silhouette/invariance metrics (hot/cold/basin metadata
  remains in the invariants bundle).
- added `scripts/hme_cli.py` plus `scripts/hme_emit_agda.py` to emit canonical
  witness JSON, cluster metrics, and invariance scores from actual DA51 inputs
  and to regenerate `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` so Agda can import
  real data without a runtime parser; `scripts/TODO.md` now tracks running these
  scripts against the curated trace JSON plus wiring `WitnessBundle` into a
  downstream module.
- ingested the QG/SL smoke payload via `SensibLaw/scripts/qg_unification_smoke.py`,
  stored the raw output plus reconstructed `qg_trace.json` and `qg_witness.json`
  under `scripts/data/`, and refreshed `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda`
  so the canonical witness matches the actual QG smoke trace.
- added `scripts/data/demo_traces.json` as a known-good DA51 trace sample, ran
  the CLI/codegen to produce `scripts/data/demo_witness.json` and the generated
  module, and introduced `DASHI/HME/Integration.agda` to show how to plug
  `canonicalWitnesses` into a `WitnessBundle` paired with an existing `Admissible`
  path so Casey/SL can consume a real proof data pair.

## 2026-03-27

- Confirmed the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` is present locally and recorded
  its exact scope: a small Lean-side perf/CBOR witness repo with
  `Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `MoonshineEarn.lean`, and
  `DashiPerf/*`, but not the missing DASL class/projection layer.
- Updated the compactified context and TODO state so future bridge work treats
  `../dashi_lean4` as an auxiliary Lean witness repo, not as the source-side
  anchor or as a replacement for `../kant-zk-pastebin`.

## 2026-03-22

- checked the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` against the current JMD-side gap
  and recorded the negative result:
  it is useful as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema witness, but it does not
  provide the missing DASL class/projection layer
  (`EigenSpace`, Bott/Hecke/orbifold class table, or source projection for
  the HEPData families), so `../kant-zk-pastebin` remains the relevant
  source-side anchor.
- promoted the family-level execution taxonomy into the Agda witness layer:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` now carries `FamilyClass`,
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentFamilyWitness.agda` exports the observed
  family classifications, and that family witness is threaded through
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`, `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, and
  `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure`.
- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TailBoundaryLemma.agda` as a theorem-facing
  current-witness module for the `mdl_tail_boundary` regime and extended
  `scripts/regime_test.py` with a `tail_boundary_lemma_latest.json` summary.
  On the current larger `dashifine` family set that summary reports
  `1` `mdl_tail_boundary` family out of `9`, with the current case
  tail-localized, terminal-boundary, cone/Fejér/closest-point admissible,
  and failing only at the MDL-exact layer.
- added `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` to aggregate the same regime across
  all currently compatible `dashifine` batches and wrote
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_batch_latest.json`.
  Current widened count is `2` `mdl_tail_boundary` instances across `3`
  datasets, still with only one unique family (`ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`), and
  both observed instances remain tail-localized and terminal-boundary.
- extended that batch aggregate with cohort/control summaries:
  repeated `pTll` families plus `dijet_chi_7tev_cms` and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas` stay interior,
  `phistar_50_76` repeats as `arrow_ladder`,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` repeats as `single_arrow_break`,
  and only `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` repeats as `mdl_tail_boundary`.
- extended the same aggregate with a compatible-dataset inventory:
  the current local `dashifine` search space contains `3` compatible step
  files and `7` tail-candidate families, of which only
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` currently leave the interior.
- refreshed the focused `z_pt_7tev_atlas` family export and recorded the
  narrower read:
  it remains a `single_arrow_break`, not a second `mdl_tail_boundary`;
  current run shows one late tail-localized arrow-only boundary step at
  `t=9->10` with `arrow_delta≈0.0305551`, all tested `v_dnorm` variants still
  nonincreasing, and clearance under the `lenient` arrow profile.
- added the first focused still-interior heavy-spectrum check:
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev` stays fully interior on the all-batch run with
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
- added the next focused heavy-spectrum control check:
  `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev` also stays fully interior on the all-batch run with
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
- pulled archived context for `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`
  (online UUID `69bf03e8-7634-839b-a9fd-74ed3616943f`,
  canonical thread `cff5c44711a788e01cdbadd98a72822ce1bb8786`) into the
  canonical archive and recorded the decision in `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`.
- tightened repo-facing symmetry language in `README.md` and
  `Docs/OrbitShellProfilesAndLorentzSignature.md` so Monster-labeled anomaly
  reports are described conservatively:
  non-separation plus, at most, a non-unique rigid substructure unless control
  comparisons show otherwise.
- updated `TODO.md` to require baseline/control comparisons before rigid-slot
  anomaly summaries are promoted into repo-facing moonshine-adjacent claims.
- added a second documentation pass from the same `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`
  thread content to record the stronger measurement split:
  JMD-side regime metadata is for structural occupancy/classification, while
  DASHI-side delta/cone/Fejér traces are for dynamics.
- updated `README.md`, `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`, and `TODO.md`
  to treat the current DA51 / exponent-vector embedding as a
  representation-level structural probe, not a reliable Monster-specific
  semantic discriminator, and to queue regime-occupancy then delta-regime
  validation as the next tests.
- added `scripts/regime_test.py` as a local CSV-driven harness for the next
  two anomaly-analysis passes:
  `occupancy` mode compares matched JMD regime distributions and numeric
  summaries between two labeled groups, while `transitions` mode compares
  DASHI-side regime-transition tables.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py` with a `cone` mode for stepwise DASHI-side
  trace analysis:
  it embeds per-step rows, computes deltas, checks a hard non-increasing cone
  on selected axes, and reports Fejér-style weighted energy drift plus
  violation breakdowns.
- added a `dashifine-closure-embedding` preset plus single-group support to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`, so existing sibling-repo files such as
  `../dashifine/hepdata_lyapunov_test_out/dashi_idk_out.csv/closure_embedding_per_step.csv`
  can be analyzed directly.
- first direct preset run on that `dashifine` file reports:
  `cone_pass_rate=0.9333`, `fejer_pass_rate=0.8500`, with the visible
  violations concentrated on `phistar_50_76` through the `v_arrow` axis.
- rewrote `scripts/regime_test.py cone` to learn the structural cone
  separately from the arrow guard:
  it now derives admissible ternary structural signatures from observed deltas,
  reports `structural_cone_pass_rate`, `arrow_pass_rate`, and
  `joint_pass_rate`, and surfaces the nearest admissible structural signature
  for each violation.
- updated the direct `dashifine` preset run after that rewrite:
  `structural_cone_pass_rate=1.0`,
  `arrow_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  `joint_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  confirming that the residual failures are localized arrow-axis breaks rather
  than structural-cone failure.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` again with ultrametric/ternary
  boundary reporting:
  it now prints structural magnitude buckets, an ultrametric-style radius
  histogram, and a focused boundary report for non-joint-admissible steps.
- direct rerun on the same `dashifine` trace confirms the
  `phistar_50_76` failures keep an admissible structural signature with zero
  nearest-signature distance; they are arrow-only boundary cases, not escapes
  from the learned structural cone.
- added an arrow-guard sweep to `scripts/regime_test.py cone` and ran it on the
  same `dashifine` preset:
  the remaining `phistar_50_76` boundary steps clear at minimum tolerances of
  roughly `4e-5`, `8e-4`, `8e-3`, and `8e-2`, giving a concrete bracket for
  any future canonical arrow guard.
- added an explicit boundary/interior class layer plus CSV export to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace this yields `56` `interior` steps and `4`
  `arrow_boundary` steps, with the exported boundary table isolating the
  `phistar_50_76` cases cleanly.
- added canonical arrow profiles to `scripts/regime_test.py cone`
  (`strict`, `boundary`, `lenient`) plus a stable artifact write path for the
  current boundary witness table at
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_latest.csv`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace those profiles currently yield
  `56/4`, `59/1`, and `60/0` for `interior/arrow_boundary`.
- added `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` as a first-pass local JMD-table
  extractor and generated
  `artifacts/regime_test/jmd_regime_table.csv` from the current Agda tree.
- identified the sibling repo `../kant-zk-pastebin` as the explicit DASL-side
  source anchor for the execution bridge and recorded that source-model role in
  `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, `TODO.md`, and
  `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` with a first-pass DASL source-model
  loader that parses `../kant-zk-pastebin/src/dasl.rs` and
  `../kant-zk-pastebin/src/sheaf.rs`, emits
  `artifacts/regime_test/dasl_source_lattice_latest.json`, and adds
  DASL-backed `dasl_eigenspace`, `basin_support`, `basin_js`, and `basin_ok`
  fields to the execution/eigen artifacts.
- tightened the semantics of that new source predicate:
  the artifacts now also export `source_support_ok` and
  `source_support_mode=parsed_dasl_eigenspace_prior`, while `basin_ok` is kept
  only as the bridge-facing compatibility alias for the same first-pass
  support-under-prior predicate.
- replaced the old trace-side `Hub` heuristic with a refined classifier that
  treats the mixed structural signature `(1,-1,1)` as `Spoke` rather than
  `Hub`, and now exports both `legacy_trace_eigenspace` and refined
  `trace_eigenspace` in the execution/eigen artifacts.
- direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family shows
  `legacy_vs_refined_trace_agreement=4/5`;
  the only changed family is `pTll_76_106`, which moves from legacy `Hub` to
  refined `Spoke`.
- immediate source-support consequence of that refined labeler:
  the previous `12/60` unsupported block disappears, and the current
  strict-profile source-support proxy now clears all `60/60` checked steps.
- updated the generated Agda witness export so `basinOK` now reflects the
  source-backed `basin_ok` predicate instead of reusing `structural_ok`.
- current direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family with the refined
  labeler keeps the existing step-class split
  (`56` `Interior`, `4` `ArrowBoundary`) while removing the earlier localized
  source-support miss.
- promoted the DASL source loader from the small encoding subset to the full
  `15`-prime Monster catalog already present in `../kant-zk-pastebin`,
  so the default source mode is now `monster-primes` and the emitted source
  JSON records the richer eigenspace distribution
  `Earth=0.4667`, `Spoke=0.4`, `Hub=0.0667`, `Clock=0.0667`.
- direct rerun on the checked `dashifine` trace family under that richer source
  catalog remains stable:
  `56` `Interior`, `4` `ArrowBoundary`, `60/60` `source_support_ok`.
- added an explicit source-projection surface on top of the richer
  `monster-primes` catalog:
  a canonical class-to-prime proxy that matches refined trace eigenspace and
  then selects the highest-exponent source prime in that class.
- current direct projections on the checked five-trace family are:
  Earth-family traces → `p2 / T_2 / exponent 46`,
  refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` → `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`.
- added a scored source-prime ranking surface on top of the canonical
  projection proxy and exported the top-ranked shortlist in the runtime
  artifacts.
- current ranked result on the checked five-trace family:
  Earth-family traces still rank `p2` first,
  while refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` now yields the first meaningful
  split between the conservative canonical and scored views:
  canonical projection stays `p17`, but the scored shortlist ranks
  `p59`, `p71`, then `p17`.
- added an explicit primary source-projection mode to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` so the runtime artifacts now export both the
  repo-default canonical projection surface and a selectable
  `primary_source_projection_*` surface driven by
  `--source-projection-primary canonical|scored`.
- added an explicit `projection_conflict` marker so rows where the canonical
  and primary-selected source representatives diverge are surfaced directly in
  the runtime artifacts without changing the canonical bridge behavior.
- retuned the scored source-prime ranking so it is now anchored to canonical
  consistency in addition to class support, exponent, and attack-triple cues,
  and labeled the exported top-k list explicitly as a diagnostic shortlist.
- exported score-component breakdowns for the ranked and primary source
  projections so the current source-side heuristic can be inspected and tuned
  explicitly in later passes.
- extended the within-class source score with `Hecke` proximity and a weak
  `Bott` cycle prior on top of trace support, exponent, canonical alignment,
  and attack-triple bonus.
- ran the same bridge across the three currently compatible `dashifine` trace
  batches and recorded the summary in
  `artifacts/regime_test/dashifine_trace_batch_latest.json`.
  Source support stayed fully intact and the refined `Spoke` family remained
  canonically `p17`; the only new movement was execution-side, where the larger
  batches added `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` to the
  arrow-boundary family list.
- added a per-family arrow-boundary summary surface to
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` and a default artifact at
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_family_latest.json`.
  Current larger-batch read:
  `phistar_50_76` is a small arrow-only tolerance ladder,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` is a single moderate arrow break,
  and `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is the strongest current outlier because it couples
  large arrow violations with `v_dnorm` failures.
- added focused family drilldown/export for `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  Current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` read is now explicit:
  first boundary at `t=10->11`,
  late arrow sign flip,
  mixed `v_arrow`/`v_dnorm` onset,
  no immediate structural-signature change on the first failing step.
- extended that focused drilldown with terminal-step autopsy data:
  per-step raw axis values, next-step axis values, per-axis deltas, and
  alternate `v_dnorm` normalizations
  (`raw`, `log_abs`, `robust_z`, `winsor95`, `family_minmax`).
  On the current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` run, the two terminal `v_dnorm`
  reversals stay positive under all tested transforms, but only at near-zero
  scale (`~9.4e-13`, `~1.6e-13`), tightening the read toward
  terminal-bin/tail-edge stiffness rather than broad cone failure.
- extended the same focused export with raw observable context from the local
  `dashifine` assets.
  The current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` export now records that the observable is a
  `7`-bin spectrum, its last bin (`x≈1350`) has the largest fractional
  uncertainty (`~8.19%`), and the first boundary onset occurs at the late
  `alpha=1e4 -> 1e5` jump.
- extended that focused export again with sibling-repo witness summaries.
  The current `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` export now records that the family still
  has `closestpoint_frac=1.0` and `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, while the explicit
  local exception is confined to the MDL-exact descent surface
  (`MDL_monotone=False`, `2` violations, worst increase `0.694577`).
- promoted the `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` family summary from the generic
  `mixed_hard_axis_outlier` bucket to a narrower `mdl_tail_boundary` class
  when the local context shows:
  tail-bin maximum fractional uncertainty,
  closest-point admissibility,
  Fejér-set admissibility,
  and an MDL-exact-only failure surface.
  This leaves the step-level witness unchanged as `ArrowBoundary` while making
  the family-level interpretation more specific.
- the first seeded JMD table rebuild in this pass produced `844` rows total
  with `7` Monster rows and `6` matched control rows.
- extended `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` to merge a repo-tracked seed
  table (`data/regime_test/jmd_regime_seed.csv`) and emit per-field semantic
  provenance columns.
- fixed `scripts/regime_test.py occupancy` so permutation tests and
  leave-one-out classification operate only on the compared `M/O` subset
  rather than leaking unlabeled rows into the statistics.
- current seeded JMD occupancy read on the matched rows is now non-empty:
  `eigenspace JS=0.5569`,
  `bott JS=0.0608`,
  `joint(eigenspace,bott,hecke) JS=0.6176`,
  with leave-one-out naive Bayes at `0.5385` on the actual matched subset.
- added a new parallel Agda bridge surface:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness`,
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityShiftWitness`,
  and a generated concrete current-trace witness module
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness`.
- threaded that new witness through `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness`,
  `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, and `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure` without
  changing `DynamicalClosureWitness`.
- extended `scripts/regime_test.py cone` with execution-admissibility and
  eigen-overlap exports:
  `artifacts/regime_test/execution_admissibility_latest.json`,
  `artifacts/regime_test/eigen_overlap_latest.csv`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness.agda`.
- direct strict-profile export still confirms the checked `dashifine` trace is
  `56` `Interior` plus `4` `ArrowBoundary`, with no structural-boundary or
  outside-class steps.
- documented that harness in `README.md` and `TODO.md`, keeping the next
  validation order explicit:
  JMD regime occupancy/divergence first, DASHI delta-regime comparisons second.

## 2026-03-20

- clarified repo-facing status docs (`README.md`, `status.md`) that
  `DASHI/Unifier.agda` is an axiomatized sketch module and not part of the
  canonical Stage C closure pipeline.
- removed misleading “assumed proven” labels in `DASHI/Unifier.agda` section
  headings (Lorentz interval, orthogonal split, wave/CCR/UV-finiteness), so the
  file reads as a placeholder interface rather than a proof-status claim.

## 2026-03-14

- changed both closure-hygiene entrypoints
  (`scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py` and
  `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh`) to skip learned `heavy` and `aggregator`
  tasks by default.
- added explicit `--include-heavy` support for aggregate integration runs, so
  routine hygiene passes stop after the relevant child modules instead of
  draining multi-hour summary targets.
- kept `--exclude-heavy` as the explicit skip flag for compatibility, but it is
  now the default behavior.

## 2026-03-12

- synchronized repo status docs with current canonical implementation:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, and `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` now explicitly include the
  implemented
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`
  segment on the canonical closure route.
- closed stale TODO entries for already-landed canonical wave-lift work in
  `TODO.md` (`Quadratic⇒Clifford` exclusivity upstream, grading/even interface,
  canonical wave-lift construction, witness-form factorization,
  canonical bundle threading).
- revalidated targeted bridge modules during the docs/TODO sync:
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
- implemented the missing `Quadratic ⇒ Signature` bridge shape in
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`:
  - added explicit theorem `quadraticConeIsotropyForces31` with inputs
    `(Quadratic, Cone, ConeMetricCompat, iso, fs, arrow)` and output
    `SignatureLaw`,
  - routed it through the two-step classification structure
    (`eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` then
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31`),
  - added `normalizedCoreClassifies31` to thread the
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` normalization seam
    into the classification path,
  - kept `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms` as the canonical
    `Signature31Theorem` constructor consumed by Stage-C bridges.
- tightened that bridge into a theorem lock package:
  - added `LorentzSignatureLock` to separate
    `(3,1)` witness,
    uniqueness of admissible signature,
    and non-admissibility of rival signatures,
  - added `lorentzSignatureLockFromCausalAxioms` as the
    `quadratic+cone+isotropy+arrow+finite-speed` lock constructor,
  - exported `lorentzLockFromIntrinsic` / `lorentzLock` wrappers through the
    intrinsic and shift headline signature modules.
- wired theorem-bearing signature fields through closure records:
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.signature31Theorem`,
  - `PhysicsClosureFull.signature31Theorem`,
  both populated from `S31OP.signature31-theorem`.
- completed a theorem-dependency audit of the quadratic=>signature path and
  removed the remaining hidden profile prerequisite from intrinsic theorem
  construction:
  - split
    `DASHI/Geometry/Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing.agda` into
    `IntrinsicSignatureCoreAxioms` (theorem-primary inputs) and
    `IntrinsicProfileWitness` (secondary witness inputs),
  - made `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` and `signature31FromIntrinsic`
    depend only on core axioms,
  - kept profile equality and profile-driven law extraction available only as
    secondary certification surfaces.
- rewired
  `DASHI/Physics/Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance.agda` to construct
  `shiftIntrinsicCoreAxioms` and `shiftProfileWitness` separately, preserving
  exports while preventing profile data from being a constructor-time
  dependency of the primary theorem.
- clarified `DASHI/Physics/Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile.agda` comments to
  state explicitly that the primary theorem export does not depend on profile
  equality input.
- finished the projection/defect split cleanup in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now derives
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` locally instead of importing those fields
  from `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- validated the canonical contraction path after cleanup with targeted checks:
  `ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- strengthened `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` so
  `WaveLift⇒Even` is theorem-shaped: added `CliffordGrading`,
  structural `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical `WaveLift` packaging, and explicit
  factorization witnesses
  `Σ e ∈ Even, waveLift s ≡ incl e` in `WaveLiftIntoEven`.
- rewired `DASHI/Physics/ConcreteClosureStack.agda` to inhabit the stronger
  canonical bridge fields by construction:
  `q2cl` now exports `mul`/`pairedWord`, and `wl` now builds
  grading + even-subalgebra + wave-lift + factorization witnesses from the
  same canonical Clifford object.
- added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda` as the
  dedicated canonical export module for
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- updated `README.md`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `TODO.md`,
  and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to lock the downstream-only
  `Quadratic⇒Clifford` dependency for `WaveLift⇒Even`.

- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` as a
  canonical closure bridge from strengthened contraction output to a Clifford
  presentation package, including:
  - normalized quadratic witness export from
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`,
  - canonical bilinear-form builder from normalized quadratic data,
  - theorem-level `Quadratic⇒Clifford` build surface,
  - explicit universal-property seam field.
- rewired `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` to export the new
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge fields.
- upgraded the universal seam in
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` from a raw placeholder to an explicit
  factorization interface (`TargetCarrier`, `factor`,
  generator-compatibility law).
- completed quadratic=>signature theorem-source hardening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda` as the canonical
    causal-classification choke point for normalized quadratics,
  - threading
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` into that module
    as the explicit normalization seam for `Q̂core`,
  - splitting the signature classification internals into
    `eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` (Lemma A) and
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31` (Lemma B),
  - rewiring `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` so
    `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` is theorem-primary through
    `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms`,
  - retaining profile equality as secondary certification via
    `profileSignatureLawFromIntrinsic`,
  - preserving `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` surface
    unchanged (`S31OP.signature31-theorem`, `S31OP.signature31`).
- completed contraction=>quadratic canonical tightening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda` as
    the explicit split/parallelogram bridge module,
  - routing `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` through that module’s canonical
    projection-defect package,
  - expanding `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields,
    while preserving
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` and
    `normalizedQuadratic` consumer behavior unchanged.
- completed the pending cross-realization snap-threshold extension by:
  - adding `Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness` as a Bool inversion-specific
    witness module on the shared closure carrier,
  - rewiring `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` to that witness,
  - adding `SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4` as a standalone `B₄` harness,
  - exporting `snapThresholdB4Verdict` through
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`,
  - wiring the new harness module into `DASHI/Everything`.
- added a Base369 normalization-hardening track in docs (`README.md`,
  `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`) to keep
  proof-soundness constraints explicit while reducing typecheck costs.
- updated `TODO.md` with explicit Base369 closed-form migration tasks and an
  `abstract`-barrier follow-up scoped to theorem-only consumers.
- added closed-form cyclic companions in `Base369.agda`:
  `fromTriIndex`, `fromHexIndex`, `fromNonaryIndex`,
  `triXor-closed`, `hexXor-closed`, `nonaryXor-closed`.
- added `triXor-spin-correct` to bridge the recursive triadic reference
  implementation back to the canonical closed-form `triXor`.
- added `hexXor-closed-correct` and `nonaryXor-closed-correct` so all Base369
  closed-form cyclic companions now have explicit correctness bridges to the
  existing recursive `spin` operators.
- switched canonical Base369 exports (`triXor`, `hexXor`, `nonaryXor`) to the
  closed-form definitions and kept recursive reference implementations as
  `triXor-spin`, `hexXor-spin`, and `nonaryXor-spin`.
- added a first conservative `abstract` rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`: theorem-bundle and moonshine-summary
  aliases now route through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving the
  existing exported names.
- extended the conservative `abstract` rollout to aggregate bundle values in
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` by routing
  each canonical bundle through an opaque `*-abs` wrapper while preserving
  exported names.
- continued the `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` rollout with a first regime
  alias batch (`RegimeSummary` through `RegimeRobustnessSummary`) routed
  through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving exported names.
- completed the remaining moonshine/regime alias rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` (`RegimeIntegrity` through
  `RegimeResilience`) using the same opaque `*-abs` wrapper pattern while
  preserving exported names.
- hardened `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` by replacing the
  fragile type-level seam equality (`Set`-valued alias + equality law) with a
  direct value-level seam witness, removing the `Set` vs `⊤` mismatch path.
- introduced a named seam record in
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`:
  `UniqueUpToScaleSeam`, and moved the contraction-uniqueness witness into
  `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`; kept compatibility via
  top-level accessor `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- simplified `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` seam typing so
  `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` is non-parameterized and set-level, while
  canonical quadratic normalization evidence remains in `normalizedQuadratic`.
- added `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` as the authoritative Stage C claim chain and
  introduced explicit module labels (`canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`) plus promotion/change-control rules.
- implemented the first concrete label registry in `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`
  for current closure-relevant modules and added an explicit canonical-first
  repo-facing citation order.
- wired closure-pipeline governance into repo metadata:
  added a README pointer, added canonical-label policy + enforcement tasks to
  `TODO.md`, and added pipeline governance/enforcement priorities to `plan.md`.
- validated the implementation with a targeted typecheck:
  `agda Base369.agda`.
- validated the new bundle-level wrappers with targeted typechecks:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after the first regime-alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after completing the remaining regime
  alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- validated the bridge-seam patch with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  and re-ran both bundle checks above.
- validated the seam-record refactor with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`,
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`,
  and `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda`.
- attempted targeted validation of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`; blocked by an
  existing upstream type error in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  (`Set !=< ⊤` around `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`), outside this scoped change.

## 2026-03-10

- replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness
  with `SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus` (proxy policy) and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import tree to use the synthetic one-minus
  realization label.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (reusing the shift
  snap witness pending a Bool inversion-specific witness).
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report that bundles
  mirror-signature exclusion with competing 4D profile failures, and wired the
  shift instance verdict into the validation summary and top-level imports.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third case and exposed a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict in the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by using a
  non-open wave-regime recovery import and keeping explicit aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite in the docs/TODO.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift validation placeholder.

## 2026-03-09

- aligned repo docs/TODO/context with the stronger archive-backed
  `Math Prof Outreach Stage` crosswalk:
  - wave / psi / graded-series bridge now described as strongly scaffolded
  - gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction now described as
    substantially scaffolded
  - quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program now described as a
    clearer candidate route
  - open physics gaps kept explicit:
    natural dynamics law,
    conserved physical quantity,
    explicit continuum limit,
    realization-independent proof,
    full gauge/matter recovery as theorem

- consolidation turn landed:
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Algebra/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung wave-regime theorem imports
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Consumers/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung recovery/consumer imports
  - kept per-rung theorem and consumer modules in place as compatibility
    surfaces; no theorem content changed in this pass

- promoted the math-prof outreach material into first-class repo docs under
  `Docs/`, including:
  a short outreach summary,
  a claim/evidence crosswalk,
  and a ranked archive-thread note tied to the canonical archived thread
  metadata.
- corrected the outreach evidence policy so canonical Agda module paths and
  repo-facing summary surfaces are now the primary citations, with
  `all_code44.txt` treated only as corroborating index evidence.
- upgraded the orbit-shell generating-series wording across the docs from
  “next object to add” to “already landed local formal object”, while keeping
  the modular / graded-trace interpretation explicitly open.
- aligned the compactified context and TODO with the same
  theorem-backed vs scaffold-present vs still-open boundary used by the new
  outreach docs.

## 2026-03-08

- cleanup/refactor turn landed:
  - removed the stale giant summary-export tail in
    `PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`
  - cleaned the duplicate export collision against
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`
  - confirmed the top-level compile is green again
  - the wave-regime widening loop can now resume on the cleaned summary/export
    surface

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime fidelity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime transparency rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- restored `DASHI.Geometry.ClosestPoint` as a geometry-side compatibility wrapper over `DASHI.Energy.ClosestPoint` so the top-level import tree compiles cleanly again.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime continuity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

  algebraic widening above the current algebraic-consistency layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredObservablesTheorem` as the next local-recovery

  on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  orbit-trace summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  ladder now has a recovery-transport-facing downstream consumer in addition
  to the spin, propagation, geometry, observable, and regime consumers,
- added `MoonshineWaveTraceConsistencySummary` as a richer finite
  graded/twined wave-consistency summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  widening above the current gauge-sector persistence layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredWavefrontTheorem` as the next local recovery
  widening above the current recovered-transport-consistency slice,

  now has a wavefront-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin,
  propagation, geometry, observable, regime, and recovery-transport consumers,

  wave-regime summary on the prototype track,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicRegimeCoherenceTheorem` as the next algebraic
  widening above the current regime-persistence slice,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredWaveObservablesTheorem` as the next local
  recovery widening above the current recovered-wave-regime slice,
- added `CanonicalWaveObservableConsumer` so the widened canonical Stage C
  ladder now has a wave-observable-facing downstream consumer,
- added `MoonshineTwinedWaveObservableSummary` as a richer finite
  graded/twined wave-observable summary on the prototype track,
- threaded those new slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, `PhysicsClosureSummary`, and
  `Everything.agda`,
- clarified the safe symmetry-interpretation order for the orbit-shell story:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  Niemeier/umbral-style only after a genuine root-lattice shell realization,
  and Monster/Moonshine only after a graded-module / trace bridge,
- added a compactified context note capturing that archived-thread decision so
  the repo-facing wording does not drift away from the canonical context,
- added a standing context-fetch note:
  when docs feel light, check the local chat archive first via
  `robust-context-fetch`, ask the user for likely online chat IDs/titles if
  needed, and always record title/IDs/source/main topics for referenced chats,
- documented Stage C as the open "minimal credible physics closure" target
  rather than a vague full-closure slogan,
- added `CanonicalGaugeConstraintBridgeTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  tying the concrete closure theorem and the gauge-contract theorem together on
  the same concrete constraint carrier,
- added `KnownLimitsPropagationSpinTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  widening the local known-limits story from local recovery/effective geometry
  to a propagation-bearing spin theorem slice,
- added `CanonicalConstraintGaugePackage` and
  `ParametricGaugeConstraintTheorem`, making the current gauge/constraint
  widening abstract over carrier while keeping the current concrete carrier as
  the first realized instance,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveryPackage` and
  `KnownLimitsCausalPropagationTheorem`, widening the current known-limits
  story beyond the local propagation/spin bridge into a local causal/effective
  propagation theorem slice,
- rewired `SpinLocalLorentzBridgeTheorem` to depend on the stronger local
  causal-propagation theorem rather than directly on the older local/effective
  geometry pair,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicClosureTheorem` as a stronger algebraic widening
  over the current canonical gauge-package layer,
- added `KnownLimitsExtendedLocalRecoveryTheorem` and a
  propagation-facing canonical consumer so the local physics runway no longer
  stops at the current coherence slice,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicCoherenceTheorem` as a stronger algebraic
  widening above the current package-parametric bridge,
- added `KnownLimitsLocalPhysicsCoherenceTheorem` as a stronger local
  recovery widening above the current extended local recovery slice,

  widening above the current local-physics-coherence layer,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicConsistencyTheorem` as a stronger algebraic
  widening above the current algebraic-bundle/stability layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredDynamicsTheorem` as a stronger local widening
  above the current complete-local-regime layer,
- added `CanonicalGeometryConsumer` so the widened canonical Stage C ladder now
  has a geometry-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin and
  propagation consumers,
- added `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle` as a richer prototype-only bundle
  over the existing detailed twined report and wave summary,
- threaded those widened theorem slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and `PhysicsClosureSummary`,
- added richer moonshine-side summary surfaces:
  `WaveGradedShellPrototypeSummary` and `TwinedComparisonSummary`,
  keeping the track explicitly finite, graded/twined, and prototype-only,
- added a dedicated design note for the minimum acceptable physics-closure
  boundary,
- reorganized `TODO.md` into theorem/dynamics, observable/prediction, shared
  integration, and deferred sections,
- introduced closure-side dynamics and observable/prediction packaging in code,
- rewired the main full-closure instances toward the intrinsic signature path
  and real shift dynamics witnesses.
- clarified the observable boundary so it now separates:
  proved outputs,
  excluded alternatives,
  and separately documented forward prediction claims.
- expanded the typed observable package with the proved current shell/orientation
  outputs and the exclusion of the non-`(3,1)` 4D candidates.
- added a repo-facing forward-prediction table with confidence levels and
  falsifiers for the current leading novel claims.
- marked profile rigidity as the flagship next-phase benchmark in the roadmap,
  minimum-closure note, README, and TODO.
- added a typed realization-profile-rigidity validation surface with benchmark
  verdicts, a shift reference report, and a tail-permutation alternate slot.
- tightened the Stage C closure boundary by exposing the minimum-credible
  adapter and authoritative dynamics/Lyapunov accessors for downstream
  consumers.
- upgraded the tail-permutation benchmark slot into a real comparison
  observation with computed shell-1 and shell-2 profiles.
- classified tail permutations as a negative control rather than an admissible
  alternate realization, and wired the first nontrivial rigidity report
  through the typed harness.
- added a concrete `P0/P1/P2` milestone document for physics closure work.
- formalized the admissible comparison realization interface so future
  profile-rigidity candidates must expose the full
  orientation/profile/signature surface.
- added an aggregate rigidity-suite report that groups:
  self exact match,
  Bool inversion admissible result,
  and tail-permutation negative control.
- implemented the first admissible alternate realization:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask, with shell-1 and
  shell-2 profile computation.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  same signature class with non-rigid shell profiles.
- refactored the intrinsic shell/orbit theorem boundary so theorem-critical
  records no longer mention finite realization fields; finite enumeration now
  remains on the shift-instance discharge side.
- added a closure-facing validation adapter so the minimum-credible Stage C
  entrypoint can expose the aggregate rigidity suite and its explicit verdicts.
- added the first admissible alternate realization implementation:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  signature agrees while profile rigidity fails.
- added a repo-facing closure validation summary surface that re-exports the
  current Stage C rigidity verdicts from the minimum-credible validation
  adapter,
- recorded the current validation snapshot explicitly in the docs and README:
  signed-permutation self-check `exactMatch`,
  Bool inversion admissible case `signatureOnlyMatch`,
  tail-permutation negative control `mismatch`.
- started the Fejér-over-χ² benchmark as a typed shift reference harness with
  theorem-backed Fejér / closest-point / MDL witnesses,
- made the χ² side explicit as a falsifier-status boundary instead of
  overstating it as a completed Agda proof.
- upgraded the χ² benchmark status from flat `pending` to an intermediate
  `interfaceWired` state when the snap / `chi2Spike` boundary is present,
- exposed the Fejér benchmark snapshot through the repo-facing closure
  validation summary:
  positive side established,
  χ² side interface-wired,
  standalone falsifier still not formalized.
- tightened the Fejér benchmark report so the positive side now carries the
  actual shift seam and MDL/Fejér witnesses directly instead of placeholder
  booleans.
- documented the Coxeter / Weyl-group direction as the preferred next
  mathematically serious alternate realization after Bool inversion,
- replaced the vocabulary-only `B₄` scaffold with an independent
  root-shell/Weyl-action shell-orbit computation,
- added a standalone `B₄` shell comparison report and exposed it through the
  validation summary without promoting it into the admissible rigidity harness,
- kept orientation/signature promotion for the `B₄` realization explicitly
  deferred until it is justified.
- added a repo-facing note documenting the orbit-shell / Lorentz-signature
  framing and the current validation ladder,
- added a typed `B₄` promotion status surface so the summary can say
  `standaloneOnly` explicitly instead of relying on prose alone.
- refined the standalone `B₄` comparison report so it now classifies the
  computed shell data by candidate shell neighborhood; the current `B₄`
  realization lands in the definite shell class `[8] / [24]`, clarifying that
  Lorentz-harness promotion is blocked structurally rather than by missing
  wiring alone.
- added a finite orbit-shell generating series layer built from orientation
  plus shell-1 / shell-2 orbit-size multiplicities.
- added theorem-backed shift-series and standalone `B₄` series modules, then
  exposed a standalone `B₄` series comparison through the closure-validation
  summary.
- added a concrete grade-0 wave-series prototype from the shift series while
  keeping it outside the theorem-critical closure path and any moonshine-level
  claim surface.
- promoted shell-neighborhood class to a first-class API shared by the shift
  reference and the standalone `B₄` comparison surface.
- added a bounded one-minus shell-family module proving the current shell-1
  family pattern for `m = 2..8`.
- refactored the standalone `B₄` report to use the canonical neighborhood type
  instead of a `B₄`-specific enum.
- updated the roadmap and TODOs so the next theorem milestone after the bounded
  family is an explicit parametric-`m` generalization.
- generalized the shell-neighborhood classifier so the one-minus family is
  recognized structurally from shell-1 triples rather than only by the bounded
  lookup cases.
- added a parametric `m` one-minus family layer that exposes the general family
  formula and its shell-neighborhood classification, while keeping the bounded
  `m = 2..8` module as the theorem-backed witness layer.
- exposed the parametric family layer through the closure validation/summary
  surface for the current shift reference.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` so it now reuses the same concrete
  constraint system, Lie structure, and closure witness as the canonical full
  closure instance instead of a trivial compatibility shim.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` in the same way, so the legacy
  assumed closure surface now also reuses the concrete constraint witness
  rather than a trivial closure shim.
- added an explicit canonical Stage C entrypoint and status surface so the
  minimum-credible closure path is authoritative in code, while compatibility
  wrappers and prototype branches remain explicitly non-canonical.
- added a typed observable-collapse benchmark surface for the shift reference,
  backed by the `RealClosureKitFiber` observable fixed-point and uniqueness
  witnesses and ready for repo-facing validation summary export.
- tightened the one-minus shell story from a parametric family layer into a
  real parametric shell-1 theorem exported through the validation summary.
- added a concrete shift-side χ²-boundary witness from the severity/snap
  layer and promoted the Fejér-over-χ² shift reference off the old
  `interfaceWired` status.
- added a standalone typed snap-threshold benchmark for the shift reference
  and exposed it through the repo-facing validation summary.
- expanded the single χ² boundary witness into a small typed shift-side
  boundary library and surfaced its size through the validation summary.
- added an independent synthetic one-minus shell-side realization in the
  Lorentz neighborhood and surfaced its standalone comparison status through
  the validation summary.
- extended the synthetic Lorentz-neighborhood candidate from shell-1-only to a
  profile-aware shell candidate with matching shell-1 and shell-2 data, while
  keeping it outside the admissible harness until orientation/signature are
  justified independently.
- added a prototype-only Lorentz-neighborhood dynamic candidate scaffold so
  the realization search now has an explicit dynamics-side placeholder without
  overstating admissible status.
- added a typed synthetic-promotion bridge so the exact blocker between the
  profile-aware synthetic candidate and admissible-harness promotion is now
  explicit in code: orientation/signature remain independently unjustified.
- strengthened the canonical shift dynamics package with an explicit status
  surface for propagation, causal admissibility, monotone quantity, and
  effective geometry, and threaded that status through the validation/closure
  summary surfaces.
- tightened the synthetic promotion path again by adding an explicit
  orientation/signature bridge from the current synthetic full-profile match;
  the remaining blocker to admissible-harness promotion is now independent
  dynamics.
- replaced the naked theorem-critical placeholder uses on the shift signature
  path with real local witness lemmas for cone nontriviality, cone/Q
  preservation, and finite-action compatibility, while keeping the public
  interface stable.
- promoted the synthetic one-minus candidate into the admissible rigidity
  harness by adding a minimal independent-dynamics witness and a concrete
  admissible realization module.
- switched the canonical admissible Stage C comparison from Bool inversion to
  the synthetic one-minus candidate; Bool inversion remains available as a
  secondary admissible `signatureOnlyMatch` comparison.
- added a typed synthetic dynamics witness module and wired the Lorentz
  neighborhood dynamic candidate through it instead of relying only on a
  descriptive scaffold record.
- added a semantics-bearing canonical dynamics witness companion, plus
  canonical constraint-closure and known-limits status surfaces, and exposed
  them through the canonical Stage C / validation summary path.
- re-exported the first scoped known-limits recovery witness and the
  witness-bearing canonical spin/Dirac consumer directly from Canonical
  Stage C, so downstream users can stay on the authoritative closure
  entrypoint instead of reconstructing those runway surfaces manually.
- added a concrete minimal canonical constraint-closure witness and a stronger
  known-limits recovery witness carrying actual propagation/effective-geometry
  data, then exposed both through the canonical Stage C / validation summary
  path.
- added a minimal algebraic-closure theorem on top of the canonical concrete
  constraint witness, and a scoped known-limits local-recovery theorem on top
  of the stronger propagation/effective-geometry recovery witness.
- added a scoped effective-geometry theorem on top of the local known-limits
  recovery theorem, so the canonical path now carries a first theorem-bearing
  local geometry slice instead of only status/witness surfaces.
- documented the next scoped runway theorem order explicitly:
  gauge-contract theorem first, then spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem.
- added a scoped canonical gauge-contract theorem on top of the concrete
  closure baseline, and a scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem on top of
  the local recovery/effective-geometry baseline.

  standalone `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite shell actions for the shift signed action and the standalone
  `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite twined shell traces via fixed-point counts for both shift and
  `B₄`, including identity and non-identity examples.
- added a wave-graded shell-module/trace adapter as a prototype-only grading
  bridge, explicitly outside the canonical Stage C closure path.
- updated docs and summary surfaces to classify this as pre-moonshine
  Weyl/theta-like infrastructure rather than a modularity, umbral, or Monster
  claim.
- added a second realized carrier instance for the carrier-parametric
  gauge/constraint theorem.
- added a local geometry-transport theorem above the current local
  causal-effective propagation slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge
  to sit downstream of it.

  theorem ladder.
- added richer finite twiner libraries for shift and `B₄`, plus a first
  graded/twined comparison report surface for the pre-moonshine track.
- added a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem layer on top of
  the existing carrier-parametric gauge theorem, plus a realized-instances
  report covering the current primary and secondary carriers.

  geometry-transport slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge to sit
  downstream of that stronger local theorem.

  over the authoritative theorem/validation ladder.

    flood from the giant selective `using` surface

    wave-regime hotspots
  - rewired `Everything.agda` to cover the new ladder modules while preserving

- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda` as the grouped local-program entrypoint.
- Updated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda` to use the local-program bundle and grouped ladder surfaces rather than mirroring `CanonicalStageC` directly.
- Marked the current turn as a cleanup/consolidation pass in the repo docs/TODO/context; no new theorem rungs added in this pass.

- Verified the grouped-import migration by typechecking `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and top-level `Everything.agda`.

- Added the `Operability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.

- Added `Sustainability` wave-regime rung across algebra, recovery, canonical consumer, and moonshine summary grouped surfaces.
- Re-focused on the actual Stage C bottleneck instead of adding more local rungs: `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries an explicit `ProjectionDefectQuadraticWitness` and a named `QuadraticUniquenessBridge`, and `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` now exposes a named `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` instead of a raw pending placeholder.

- 2026-03-29: threaded the RG universality toy through the same shell with a relevant/irrelevant state split, exact refinement on the irrelevant sector, quotient-trivial observables (`relevantObs`, `irrelevantDefectObs`), and recovery lemmas derived from the scalar contraction.
- 2026-03-29: added `DASHI/Physics/LocalWitness.agda` so toys can carry explicit local operator/scaling/observable-invariance witnesses instead of relying on repo-global structures.
- 2026-03-29: upgraded `DASHI/Physics/Toy/ScalarContinuum.agda` again from the one-sided gate to a more symmetric centered local relaxation, added a nontrivial global sign-flip action and support-quotient, and switched the refinement tower to an intentionally coarse approximate witness while keeping recovery/typecheck intact.
- 2026-03-29: upgraded `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` from the earlier quotient-trivial shell to a sign-flip quotient on the irrelevant sector plus local operator/scaling/observable witnesses.

- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGUniversality.agda` with an explicit renormalization family `rgRenormalize` and `RGRenormalizationBundle`, making the coarse-graining story a named operator package rather than only a flat lemma collection
- extend `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda` with `RGRenormalizationSummary`

- extend the mixed RG benchmark surface with cross-schedule theorems (`rgMixed-rel-benchmark-agree`, `rgMixed-recovered-same-class`, `rgMixed-recovered-observable-agree`, `rgMixed-recovered-benchmark-mismatch-zero`) and expose them through `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda`

- add a parallel richer RG benchmark score layer (`RGBenchmarkScore`) with four channels (`endpoint`, `path`, `recovery`, `scale`), expose it through `rgRichBenchmarkMatch`, `rgMixedRichBenchmarkMatch`, `RGRichBenchmarkSummary`, and the unified toy bundle, and prove self/recovered zero-score theorems for the new structured score without breaking the earlier thin compatibility score

- extend that Phase-3 split from the one-layer witness to arbitrary positive uniform coarse depth in `holdMode` via `rgRunUniformMixed2-hold-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-tail-path-on-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-flip-path-on-vacuum`, and `rgUniformMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split`; expose the deeper witness through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary.uniform-tail-vs-flip-positive-depth-split`
- add the first non-vacuum Phase-3 hold witness: `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-one-layer-hold-endpoint-class` and `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-one-layer-hold-path-step` show that one-layer `holdMode` tail-vs-flip schedules agree on endpoint class for arbitrary states while the raw path channel differs by one; expose it through `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary.one-layer-hold-raw-split`
- probe widening the canonical abstract-bundle conserved charge with `heckeSignature`, then back the change out after Agda shows it fails on the concrete `CP` branch under the current closure-derived law
- update `Docs/AbstractGaugeMatterBundle.md`, `Docs/DynamicsInvariantGapChecklist.md`, and `TODO.md` to record that `heckeSignature` and `eigenSummary` remain observable-side only for the current law, and that adding more canonical transported phase families is now lower-value than a less canonical target family or a stronger dynamics law
- added [`Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md`](./Docs/HeckeRepresentationLayer.md)
  to record the now-archived boundary from `Dashi and Physics Insights`:
  Hecke/FRACTRAN belong first on the prime-lattice representation layer rather
  than as the next default conserved charge in the contractive closure lane.
- strengthened `scripts/moonshine_prime_from_twined_trace_shift.py` with the
  first principled metadata lift from finite-twined report fields into the
  normalized observable, adding `normalizedObservable` report counts, support,
  and eigen-ratio summary data rather than leaving all richer report structure
  stranded under `traceReport`
- updated `Docs/MoonshinePrimeObject.md` and `TODO.md` to record that this
  first principled lift is now landed and that the next moonshine step is a
  richer normalized-observable lift beyond verdict-slot/cardinality metadata
