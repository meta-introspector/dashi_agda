# Changelog

## 2026-03-14

- changed both closure-hygiene entrypoints
  (`scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py` and
  `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh`) to skip learned `heavy` and `aggregator`
  tasks by default.
- added explicit `--include-heavy` support for aggregate integration runs, so
  routine hygiene passes stop after the relevant child modules instead of
  draining multi-hour summary targets.
- kept `--exclude-heavy` as the explicit skip flag for compatibility, but it is
  now the default behavior.

## 2026-03-12

- synchronized repo status docs with current canonical implementation:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, and `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` now explicitly include the
  implemented
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`
  segment on the canonical closure route.
- closed stale TODO entries for already-landed canonical wave-lift work in
  `TODO.md` (`Quadratic⇒Clifford` exclusivity upstream, grading/even interface,
  canonical wave-lift construction, witness-form factorization,
  canonical bundle threading).
- revalidated targeted bridge modules during the docs/TODO sync:
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
- implemented the missing `Quadratic ⇒ Signature` bridge shape in
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`:
  - added explicit theorem `quadraticConeIsotropyForces31` with inputs
    `(Quadratic, Cone, ConeMetricCompat, iso, fs, arrow)` and output
    `SignatureLaw`,
  - routed it through the two-step classification structure
    (`eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` then
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31`),
  - added `normalizedCoreClassifies31` to thread the
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` normalization seam
    into the classification path,
  - kept `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms` as the canonical
    `Signature31Theorem` constructor consumed by Stage-C bridges.
- tightened that bridge into a theorem lock package:
  - added `LorentzSignatureLock` to separate
    `(3,1)` witness,
    uniqueness of admissible signature,
    and non-admissibility of rival signatures,
  - added `lorentzSignatureLockFromCausalAxioms` as the
    `quadratic+cone+isotropy+arrow+finite-speed` lock constructor,
  - exported `lorentzLockFromIntrinsic` / `lorentzLock` wrappers through the
    intrinsic and shift headline signature modules.
- wired theorem-bearing signature fields through closure records:
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.signature31Theorem`,
  - `PhysicsClosureFull.signature31Theorem`,
  both populated from `S31OP.signature31-theorem`.
- completed a theorem-dependency audit of the quadratic=>signature path and
  removed the remaining hidden profile prerequisite from intrinsic theorem
  construction:
  - split
    `DASHI/Geometry/Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing.agda` into
    `IntrinsicSignatureCoreAxioms` (theorem-primary inputs) and
    `IntrinsicProfileWitness` (secondary witness inputs),
  - made `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` and `signature31FromIntrinsic`
    depend only on core axioms,
  - kept profile equality and profile-driven law extraction available only as
    secondary certification surfaces.
- rewired
  `DASHI/Physics/Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance.agda` to construct
  `shiftIntrinsicCoreAxioms` and `shiftProfileWitness` separately, preserving
  exports while preventing profile data from being a constructor-time
  dependency of the primary theorem.
- clarified `DASHI/Physics/Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile.agda` comments to
  state explicitly that the primary theorem export does not depend on profile
  equality input.
- finished the projection/defect split cleanup in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now derives
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` locally instead of importing those fields
  from `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- validated the canonical contraction path after cleanup with targeted checks:
  `ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- strengthened `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` so
  `WaveLift⇒Even` is theorem-shaped: added `CliffordGrading`,
  structural `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical `WaveLift` packaging, and explicit
  factorization witnesses
  `Σ e ∈ Even, waveLift s ≡ incl e` in `WaveLiftIntoEven`.
- rewired `DASHI/Physics/ConcreteClosureStack.agda` to inhabit the stronger
  canonical bridge fields by construction:
  `q2cl` now exports `mul`/`pairedWord`, and `wl` now builds
  grading + even-subalgebra + wave-lift + factorization witnesses from the
  same canonical Clifford object.
- added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda` as the
  dedicated canonical export module for
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- updated `README.md`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `TODO.md`,
  and `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md` to lock the downstream-only
  `Quadratic⇒Clifford` dependency for `WaveLift⇒Even`.

- added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` as a
  canonical closure bridge from strengthened contraction output to a Clifford
  presentation package, including:
  - normalized quadratic witness export from
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`,
  - canonical bilinear-form builder from normalized quadratic data,
  - theorem-level `Quadratic⇒Clifford` build surface,
  - explicit universal-property seam field.
- rewired `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` to export the new
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge fields.
- upgraded the universal seam in
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` from a raw placeholder to an explicit
  factorization interface (`TargetCarrier`, `factor`,
  generator-compatibility law).
- completed quadratic=>signature theorem-source hardening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda` as the canonical
    causal-classification choke point for normalized quadratics,
  - threading
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness` into that module
    as the explicit normalization seam for `Q̂core`,
  - splitting the signature classification internals into
    `eliminateEuclideanAndDegenerate` (Lemma A) and
    `spatialIsotropyAndArrowForce31` (Lemma B),
  - rewiring `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` so
    `signature31-theoremFromIntrinsic` is theorem-primary through
    `lorentz31-from-causal-axioms`,
  - retaining profile equality as secondary certification via
    `profileSignatureLawFromIntrinsic`,
  - preserving `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` surface
    unchanged (`S31OP.signature31-theorem`, `S31OP.signature31`).
- completed contraction=>quadratic canonical tightening by:
  - adding `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda` as
    the explicit split/parallelogram bridge module,
  - routing `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` through that module’s canonical
    projection-defect package,
  - expanding `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields,
    while preserving
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` and
    `normalizedQuadratic` consumer behavior unchanged.
- completed the pending cross-realization snap-threshold extension by:
  - adding `Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness` as a Bool inversion-specific
    witness module on the shared closure carrier,
  - rewiring `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` to that witness,
  - adding `SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4` as a standalone `B₄` harness,
  - exporting `snapThresholdB4Verdict` through
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`,
  - wiring the new harness module into `DASHI/Everything`.
- added a Base369 normalization-hardening track in docs (`README.md`,
  `architecture.md`, `plan.md`, `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`) to keep
  proof-soundness constraints explicit while reducing typecheck costs.
- updated `TODO.md` with explicit Base369 closed-form migration tasks and an
  `abstract`-barrier follow-up scoped to theorem-only consumers.
- added closed-form cyclic companions in `Base369.agda`:
  `fromTriIndex`, `fromHexIndex`, `fromNonaryIndex`,
  `triXor-closed`, `hexXor-closed`, `nonaryXor-closed`.
- added `triXor-spin-correct` to bridge the recursive triadic reference
  implementation back to the canonical closed-form `triXor`.
- added `hexXor-closed-correct` and `nonaryXor-closed-correct` so all Base369
  closed-form cyclic companions now have explicit correctness bridges to the
  existing recursive `spin` operators.
- switched canonical Base369 exports (`triXor`, `hexXor`, `nonaryXor`) to the
  closed-form definitions and kept recursive reference implementations as
  `triXor-spin`, `hexXor-spin`, and `nonaryXor-spin`.
- added a first conservative `abstract` rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`: theorem-bundle and moonshine-summary
  aliases now route through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving the
  existing exported names.
- extended the conservative `abstract` rollout to aggregate bundle values in
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` by routing
  each canonical bundle through an opaque `*-abs` wrapper while preserving
  exported names.
- continued the `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` rollout with a first regime
  alias batch (`RegimeSummary` through `RegimeRobustnessSummary`) routed
  through opaque `*-abs` wrappers while preserving exported names.
- completed the remaining moonshine/regime alias rollout in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` (`RegimeIntegrity` through
  `RegimeResilience`) using the same opaque `*-abs` wrapper pattern while
  preserving exported names.
- hardened `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` by replacing the
  fragile type-level seam equality (`Set`-valued alias + equality law) with a
  direct value-level seam witness, removing the `Set` vs `⊤` mismatch path.
- introduced a named seam record in
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`:
  `UniqueUpToScaleSeam`, and moved the contraction-uniqueness witness into
  `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`; kept compatibility via
  top-level accessor `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- simplified `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` seam typing so
  `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` is non-parameterized and set-level, while
  canonical quadratic normalization evidence remains in `normalizedQuadratic`.
- added `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` as the authoritative Stage C claim chain and
  introduced explicit module labels (`canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`) plus promotion/change-control rules.
- implemented the first concrete label registry in `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`
  for current closure-relevant modules and added an explicit canonical-first
  repo-facing citation order.
- wired closure-pipeline governance into repo metadata:
  added a README pointer, added canonical-label policy + enforcement tasks to
  `TODO.md`, and added pipeline governance/enforcement priorities to `plan.md`.
- validated the implementation with a targeted typecheck:
  `agda Base369.agda`.
- validated the new bundle-level wrappers with targeted typechecks:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after the first regime-alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- re-validated bundle-level modules after completing the remaining regime
  alias batch:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda` and
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle.agda`.
- validated the bridge-seam patch with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  and re-ran both bundle checks above.
- validated the seam-record refactor with:
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`,
  `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`,
  and `agda DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle.agda`.
- attempted targeted validation of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`; blocked by an
  existing upstream type error in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
  (`Set !=< ⊤` around `uniqueUpToScaleSeam`), outside this scoped change.

## 2026-03-10

- replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness
  with `SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus` (proxy policy) and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import tree to use the synthetic one-minus
  realization label.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (reusing the shift
  snap witness pending a Bool inversion-specific witness).
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report that bundles
  mirror-signature exclusion with competing 4D profile failures, and wired the
  shift instance verdict into the validation summary and top-level imports.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third case and exposed a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict in the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by using a
  non-open wave-regime recovery import and keeping explicit aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite in the docs/TODO.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift validation placeholder.

## 2026-03-09

- aligned repo docs/TODO/context with the stronger archive-backed
  `Math Prof Outreach Stage` crosswalk:
  - wave / psi / graded-series bridge now described as strongly scaffolded
  - gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction now described as
    substantially scaffolded
  - quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program now described as a
    clearer candidate route
  - open physics gaps kept explicit:
    natural dynamics law,
    conserved physical quantity,
    explicit continuum limit,
    realization-independent proof,
    full gauge/matter recovery as theorem

- consolidation turn landed:
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Algebra/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung wave-regime theorem imports
  - rewired `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` to use grouped
    `Closure/Recovery/WaveRegime` and `Closure/Consumers/WaveRegime` imports
    instead of direct per-rung recovery/consumer imports
  - kept per-rung theorem and consumer modules in place as compatibility
    surfaces; no theorem content changed in this pass

- promoted the math-prof outreach material into first-class repo docs under
  `Docs/`, including:
  a short outreach summary,
  a claim/evidence crosswalk,
  and a ranked archive-thread note tied to the canonical archived thread
  metadata.
- corrected the outreach evidence policy so canonical Agda module paths and
  repo-facing summary surfaces are now the primary citations, with
  `all_code44.txt` treated only as corroborating index evidence.
- upgraded the orbit-shell generating-series wording across the docs from
  “next object to add” to “already landed local formal object”, while keeping
  the modular / graded-trace interpretation explicitly open.
- aligned the compactified context and TODO with the same
  theorem-backed vs scaffold-present vs still-open boundary used by the new
  outreach docs.

## 2026-03-08

- cleanup/refactor turn landed:
  - removed the stale giant summary-export tail in
    `PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`
  - cleaned the duplicate export collision against
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`
  - confirmed the top-level compile is green again
  - the wave-regime widening loop can now resume on the cleaned summary/export
    surface

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime convergence rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime integration rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime concordance rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime compatibility rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime fidelity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime transparency rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- restored `DASHI.Geometry.ClosestPoint` as a geometry-side compatibility wrapper over `DASHI.Energy.ClosestPoint` so the top-level import tree compiles cleanly again.

- added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime continuity rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.

  algebraic widening above the current algebraic-consistency layer,

  orbit-trace summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  ladder now has a recovery-transport-facing downstream consumer in addition
  to the spin, propagation, geometry, observable, and regime consumers,
- added `MoonshineWaveTraceConsistencySummary` as a richer finite
  graded/twined wave-consistency summary on the parallel pre-moonshine track,

  widening above the current gauge-sector persistence layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredWavefrontTheorem` as the next local recovery
  widening above the current recovered-transport-consistency slice,

  now has a wavefront-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin,

  wave-regime summary on the prototype track,

  recovery widening above the current recovered-wave-regime slice,

  ladder now has a wave-observable-facing downstream consumer,
- added `MoonshineTwinedWaveObservableSummary` as a richer finite
  graded/twined wave-observable summary on the prototype track,
- threaded those new slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, `PhysicsClosureSummary`, and
  `Everything.agda`,
- clarified the safe symmetry-interpretation order for the orbit-shell story:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  Niemeier/umbral-style only after a genuine root-lattice shell realization,
  and Monster/Moonshine only after a graded-module / trace bridge,
- added a compactified context note capturing that archived-thread decision so
  the repo-facing wording does not drift away from the canonical context,
- added a standing context-fetch note:
  when docs feel light, check the local chat archive first via
  `robust-context-fetch`, ask the user for likely online chat IDs/titles if
  needed, and always record title/IDs/source/main topics for referenced chats,
- documented Stage C as the open "minimal credible physics closure" target
  rather than a vague full-closure slogan,
- added `CanonicalGaugeConstraintBridgeTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  tying the concrete closure theorem and the gauge-contract theorem together on
  the same concrete constraint carrier,
- added `KnownLimitsPropagationSpinTheorem` on the canonical Stage C path,
  widening the local known-limits story from local recovery/effective geometry
  to a propagation-bearing spin theorem slice,
- added `CanonicalConstraintGaugePackage` and
  `ParametricGaugeConstraintTheorem`, making the current gauge/constraint
  widening abstract over carrier while keeping the current concrete carrier as
  the first realized instance,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveryPackage` and
  `KnownLimitsCausalPropagationTheorem`, widening the current known-limits
  story beyond the local propagation/spin bridge into a local causal/effective
  propagation theorem slice,
- rewired `SpinLocalLorentzBridgeTheorem` to depend on the stronger local
  causal-propagation theorem rather than directly on the older local/effective
  geometry pair,
- added `ParametricAlgebraicClosureTheorem` as a stronger algebraic widening
  over the current canonical gauge-package layer,
- added `KnownLimitsExtendedLocalRecoveryTheorem` and a
  propagation-facing canonical consumer so the local physics runway no longer
  stops at the current coherence slice,

  widening above the current package-parametric bridge,
- added `KnownLimitsLocalPhysicsCoherenceTheorem` as a stronger local

  widening above the current local-physics-coherence layer,

  widening above the current algebraic-bundle/stability layer,
- added `KnownLimitsRecoveredDynamicsTheorem` as a stronger local widening
  above the current complete-local-regime layer,
- added `CanonicalGeometryConsumer` so the widened canonical Stage C ladder now
  has a geometry-facing downstream consumer in addition to the spin and
  propagation consumers,
- added `MoonshinePrototypeComparisonBundle` as a richer prototype-only bundle
  over the existing detailed twined report and wave summary,
- threaded those widened theorem slices through `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and `PhysicsClosureSummary`,
- added richer moonshine-side summary surfaces:
  `WaveGradedShellPrototypeSummary` and `TwinedComparisonSummary`,
  keeping the track explicitly finite, graded/twined, and prototype-only,
- added a dedicated design note for the minimum acceptable physics-closure
  boundary,
- reorganized `TODO.md` into theorem/dynamics, observable/prediction, shared
  integration, and deferred sections,
- introduced closure-side dynamics and observable/prediction packaging in code,
- rewired the main full-closure instances toward the intrinsic signature path
  and real shift dynamics witnesses.
- clarified the observable boundary so it now separates:
  proved outputs,
  excluded alternatives,
  and separately documented forward prediction claims.
- expanded the typed observable package with the proved current shell/orientation
  outputs and the exclusion of the non-`(3,1)` 4D candidates.
- added a repo-facing forward-prediction table with confidence levels and
  falsifiers for the current leading novel claims.
- marked profile rigidity as the flagship next-phase benchmark in the roadmap,
  minimum-closure note, README, and TODO.
- added a typed realization-profile-rigidity validation surface with benchmark
  verdicts, a shift reference report, and a tail-permutation alternate slot.
- tightened the Stage C closure boundary by exposing the minimum-credible
  adapter and authoritative dynamics/Lyapunov accessors for downstream
  consumers.
- upgraded the tail-permutation benchmark slot into a real comparison
  observation with computed shell-1 and shell-2 profiles.
- classified tail permutations as a negative control rather than an admissible
  alternate realization, and wired the first nontrivial rigidity report
  through the typed harness.
- added a concrete `P0/P1/P2` milestone document for physics closure work.
- formalized the admissible comparison realization interface so future
  profile-rigidity candidates must expose the full
  orientation/profile/signature surface.
- added an aggregate rigidity-suite report that groups:
  self exact match,
  Bool inversion admissible result,
  and tail-permutation negative control.
- implemented the first admissible alternate realization:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask, with shell-1 and
  shell-2 profile computation.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  same signature class with non-rigid shell profiles.
- refactored the intrinsic shell/orbit theorem boundary so theorem-critical
  records no longer mention finite realization fields; finite enumeration now
  remains on the shift-instance discharge side.
- added a closure-facing validation adapter so the minimum-credible Stage C
  entrypoint can expose the aggregate rigidity suite and its explicit verdicts.
- added the first admissible alternate realization implementation:
  the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask.
- refined rigidity verdict semantics so `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
  signature agrees while profile rigidity fails.
- added a repo-facing closure validation summary surface that re-exports the
  current Stage C rigidity verdicts from the minimum-credible validation
  adapter,
- recorded the current validation snapshot explicitly in the docs and README:
  signed-permutation self-check `exactMatch`,
  Bool inversion admissible case `signatureOnlyMatch`,
  tail-permutation negative control `mismatch`.
- started the Fejér-over-χ² benchmark as a typed shift reference harness with
  theorem-backed Fejér / closest-point / MDL witnesses,
- made the χ² side explicit as a falsifier-status boundary instead of
  overstating it as a completed Agda proof.
- upgraded the χ² benchmark status from flat `pending` to an intermediate
  `interfaceWired` state when the snap / `chi2Spike` boundary is present,
- exposed the Fejér benchmark snapshot through the repo-facing closure
  validation summary:
  positive side established,
  χ² side interface-wired,
  standalone falsifier still not formalized.
- tightened the Fejér benchmark report so the positive side now carries the
  actual shift seam and MDL/Fejér witnesses directly instead of placeholder
  booleans.
- documented the Coxeter / Weyl-group direction as the preferred next
  mathematically serious alternate realization after Bool inversion,
- replaced the vocabulary-only `B₄` scaffold with an independent
  root-shell/Weyl-action shell-orbit computation,
- added a standalone `B₄` shell comparison report and exposed it through the
  validation summary without promoting it into the admissible rigidity harness,
- kept orientation/signature promotion for the `B₄` realization explicitly
  deferred until it is justified.
- added a repo-facing note documenting the orbit-shell / Lorentz-signature
  framing and the current validation ladder,
- added a typed `B₄` promotion status surface so the summary can say
  `standaloneOnly` explicitly instead of relying on prose alone.
- refined the standalone `B₄` comparison report so it now classifies the
  computed shell data by candidate shell neighborhood; the current `B₄`
  realization lands in the definite shell class `[8] / [24]`, clarifying that
  Lorentz-harness promotion is blocked structurally rather than by missing
  wiring alone.
- added a finite orbit-shell generating series layer built from orientation
  plus shell-1 / shell-2 orbit-size multiplicities.
- added theorem-backed shift-series and standalone `B₄` series modules, then
  exposed a standalone `B₄` series comparison through the closure-validation
  summary.
- added a concrete grade-0 wave-series prototype from the shift series while
  keeping it outside the theorem-critical closure path and any moonshine-level
  claim surface.
- promoted shell-neighborhood class to a first-class API shared by the shift
  reference and the standalone `B₄` comparison surface.
- added a bounded one-minus shell-family module proving the current shell-1
  family pattern for `m = 2..8`.
- refactored the standalone `B₄` report to use the canonical neighborhood type
  instead of a `B₄`-specific enum.
- updated the roadmap and TODOs so the next theorem milestone after the bounded
  family is an explicit parametric-`m` generalization.
- generalized the shell-neighborhood classifier so the one-minus family is
  recognized structurally from shell-1 triples rather than only by the bounded
  lookup cases.
- added a parametric `m` one-minus family layer that exposes the general family
  formula and its shell-neighborhood classification, while keeping the bounded
  `m = 2..8` module as the theorem-backed witness layer.
- exposed the parametric family layer through the closure validation/summary
  surface for the current shift reference.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` so it now reuses the same concrete
  constraint system, Lie structure, and closure witness as the canonical full
  closure instance instead of a trivial compatibility shim.
- hardened `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` in the same way, so the legacy
  assumed closure surface now also reuses the concrete constraint witness
  rather than a trivial closure shim.
- added an explicit canonical Stage C entrypoint and status surface so the
  minimum-credible closure path is authoritative in code, while compatibility
  wrappers and prototype branches remain explicitly non-canonical.
- added a typed observable-collapse benchmark surface for the shift reference,
  backed by the `RealClosureKitFiber` observable fixed-point and uniqueness
  witnesses and ready for repo-facing validation summary export.
- tightened the one-minus shell story from a parametric family layer into a
  real parametric shell-1 theorem exported through the validation summary.
- added a concrete shift-side χ²-boundary witness from the severity/snap
  layer and promoted the Fejér-over-χ² shift reference off the old
  `interfaceWired` status.
- added a standalone typed snap-threshold benchmark for the shift reference
  and exposed it through the repo-facing validation summary.
- expanded the single χ² boundary witness into a small typed shift-side
  boundary library and surfaced its size through the validation summary.
- added an independent synthetic one-minus shell-side realization in the
  Lorentz neighborhood and surfaced its standalone comparison status through
  the validation summary.
- extended the synthetic Lorentz-neighborhood candidate from shell-1-only to a
  profile-aware shell candidate with matching shell-1 and shell-2 data, while
  keeping it outside the admissible harness until orientation/signature are
  justified independently.
- added a prototype-only Lorentz-neighborhood dynamic candidate scaffold so
  the realization search now has an explicit dynamics-side placeholder without
  overstating admissible status.
- added a typed synthetic-promotion bridge so the exact blocker between the
  profile-aware synthetic candidate and admissible-harness promotion is now
  explicit in code: orientation/signature remain independently unjustified.
- strengthened the canonical shift dynamics package with an explicit status
  surface for propagation, causal admissibility, monotone quantity, and
  effective geometry, and threaded that status through the validation/closure
  summary surfaces.
- tightened the synthetic promotion path again by adding an explicit
  orientation/signature bridge from the current synthetic full-profile match;
  the remaining blocker to admissible-harness promotion is now independent
  dynamics.
- replaced the naked theorem-critical placeholder uses on the shift signature
  path with real local witness lemmas for cone nontriviality, cone/Q
  preservation, and finite-action compatibility, while keeping the public
  interface stable.
- promoted the synthetic one-minus candidate into the admissible rigidity
  harness by adding a minimal independent-dynamics witness and a concrete
  admissible realization module.
- switched the canonical admissible Stage C comparison from Bool inversion to
  the synthetic one-minus candidate; Bool inversion remains available as a
  secondary admissible `signatureOnlyMatch` comparison.
- added a typed synthetic dynamics witness module and wired the Lorentz
  neighborhood dynamic candidate through it instead of relying only on a
  descriptive scaffold record.
- added a semantics-bearing canonical dynamics witness companion, plus
  canonical constraint-closure and known-limits status surfaces, and exposed
  them through the canonical Stage C / validation summary path.
- re-exported the first scoped known-limits recovery witness and the
  witness-bearing canonical spin/Dirac consumer directly from Canonical
  Stage C, so downstream users can stay on the authoritative closure
  entrypoint instead of reconstructing those runway surfaces manually.
- added a concrete minimal canonical constraint-closure witness and a stronger
  known-limits recovery witness carrying actual propagation/effective-geometry
  data, then exposed both through the canonical Stage C / validation summary
  path.
- added a minimal algebraic-closure theorem on top of the canonical concrete
  constraint witness, and a scoped known-limits local-recovery theorem on top
  of the stronger propagation/effective-geometry recovery witness.
- added a scoped effective-geometry theorem on top of the local known-limits
  recovery theorem, so the canonical path now carries a first theorem-bearing
  local geometry slice instead of only status/witness surfaces.
- documented the next scoped runway theorem order explicitly:
  gauge-contract theorem first, then spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem.
- added a scoped canonical gauge-contract theorem on top of the concrete
  closure baseline, and a scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem on top of
  the local recovery/effective-geometry baseline.
- added finite graded orbit-shell series for the shift signed action and the
  standalone `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite shell actions for the shift signed action and the standalone
  `B₄` Weyl action.
- added finite twined shell traces via fixed-point counts for both shift and
  `B₄`, including identity and non-identity examples.
- added a wave-graded shell-module/trace adapter as a prototype-only grading
  bridge, explicitly outside the canonical Stage C closure path.
- updated docs and summary surfaces to classify this as pre-moonshine
  Weyl/theta-like infrastructure rather than a modularity, umbral, or Monster
  claim.
- added a second realized carrier instance for the carrier-parametric
  gauge/constraint theorem.
- added a local geometry-transport theorem above the current local
  causal-effective propagation slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge
  to sit downstream of it.
- added a canonical Stage C theorem bundle aggregating the current runway
  theorem ladder.
- added richer finite twiner libraries for shift and `B₄`, plus a first
  graded/twined comparison report surface for the pre-moonshine track.
- added a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem layer on top of
  the existing carrier-parametric gauge theorem, plus a realized-instances
  report covering the current primary and secondary carriers.
- added a local causal-geometry coherence theorem above the current
  geometry-transport slice and rewired the spin/local-Lorentz bridge to sit
  downstream of that stronger local theorem.
- added a canonical Stage C summary bundle as a read-only aggregation surface
  over the authoritative theorem/validation ladder.
- widened the pre-moonshine comparison layer with additional labeled twiner
  cases for shift and `B₄`, plus a richer detailed graded/twined comparison
  report.

  canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime coherence slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.

- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime robustness slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Exported the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime resilience slice through the canonical summary surfaces and top-level import tree.
- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime harmony rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime balance rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- Added the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime symmetry rung across algebra, known-limits, canonical consumer, and pre-moonshine summary surfaces, then re-exported it through the canonical summaries and top-level tree.
- cleanup pass:
  - simplified `PhysicsClosureSummary` export behavior to stop the stale warning
    flood from the giant selective `using` surface
  - added short-path ladder/wrapper modules for the closure and moonshine
    wave-regime hotspots
  - rewired `Everything.agda` to cover the new ladder modules while preserving
    compatibility with the old long module names
- Restored the legacy `MDL.Core.Core` import path as a compatibility wrapper so the widened closure/dynamics ladder continues to compile against older module references.
- Restored the legacy `Monster.TraceCounts` import path as a compatibility wrapper so the top-level legacy Monster path continues to compile.

- Added the short-path `Legibility` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on both the algebra and known-limits ladders, plus its canonical consumer and moonshine summary surface.

- Tightened `Closure/Canonical/Ladder` so it no longer publicly re-exports both grouped wave-regime ladders and `CanonicalStageC`, eliminating the duplicate-export collision on the cleaned canonical summary path.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda` as the grouped local-program entrypoint.
- Updated `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda` to use the local-program bundle and grouped ladder surfaces rather than mirroring `CanonicalStageC` directly.
- Marked the current turn as a cleanup/consolidation pass in the repo docs/TODO/context; no new theorem rungs added in this pass.
- Rewired `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` to grouped wave-regime imports with internal compatibility aliases, eliminating the last direct per-rung dependency on the validation summary path.
- Verified the grouped-import migration by typechecking `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and top-level `Everything.agda`.
- Added the `Traceability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Added the `Auditability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.

- Added the `Operability` rung across the cleaned wave-regime cycle: algebra theorem, recovered theorem, canonical consumer, moonshine summary, and canonical/validation exports.
- Fixed canonical Stage C alias collisions between `Compatibility` and `Composability` on the algebra, recovery, and consumer ladders; `CanonicalStageC.agda` now uses distinct aliases and the grouped summary path compiles cleanly again.
- Added `Sustainability` wave-regime rung across algebra, recovery, canonical consumer, and moonshine summary grouped surfaces.
- Re-focused on the actual Stage C bottleneck instead of adding more local rungs: `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries an explicit `ProjectionDefectQuadraticWitness` and a named `QuadraticUniquenessBridge`, and `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` now exposes a named `QuadraticToSignatureBridgeSeam` instead of a raw pending placeholder.
