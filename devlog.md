# Devlog

- 2026-03-11: Strengthened `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with a concrete
  invariant witness field (`invariantQuadraticWitness`) and added
  `canonicalIdentityInvariantStrong` as the first non-placeholder witness
  instance while keeping `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` explicitly open.
- 2026-03-10: Re-baselined Stage-C status after audit: downgraded the previous
  "five-pillar complete" wording to "packaging complete, bottleneck proof
  still open". Added two bottleneck modules:
  `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram` and
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`, where the remaining
  invariant/uniqueness obligations are explicit seams.
- 2026-03-10: Added `PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem` and threaded it through
  canonical Stage C exports (`CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, and `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) so the
  five target milestones are represented as one explicit theorem package:
  natural dynamics law, conserved quantity, continuum limit,
  realization-independent proof, and full gauge/matter recovery theorem.
- 2026-03-10: Replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness with a synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`, proxy policy), rewired `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` and `Everything` to consume it, and updated plan/TODO/status/docs to track the cross-realization validation package as in progress.
- 2026-03-10: Added a synthetic one-minus non-shift snap policy derived from the witness state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the shift snap witness), updated validation exports, and retargeted the next snap-threshold step to the Bool inversion witness + B₄ harness.
- 2026-03-10: Bug-hunter cycle: reproduced `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` failure (exit 42), fixed exported alias collisions in wave-regime consumers (`KLRWOTGRC`, `KLRWOTGRCOMP`) by making them private, then fixed a `rigidityAggregate` multiple-definition collision in `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` by switching `RealizationProfileRigidityShift` to a qualified import; targeted scope-check now passes, while full typechecks were cut short by runtime limits in this environment.
- 2026-03-10: Added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a provisional non-shift validation placeholder.
- 2026-03-10: Documented the condensed priority roadmap and the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite so the next validation step is explicit.
- 2026-03-10: Fixed a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open import and keeping explicit aliases; kicked off a recheck of the module.
- 2026-03-10: Expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and added a tertiary snap-threshold harness wired into the validation summary.
- 2026-03-10: Added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- 2026-03-10: Added preferred harness/dataset column to the forward prediction validation table and marked the TODO item complete.
- 2026-03-10: Extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the shift reference with a secondary shift-side boundary case, wired the verdict into the validation summary, and refreshed docs/plan/TODO/status/changelog.
- 2026-03-10: Added a falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report (mirror-signature exclusion and competing 4D profile failures) and wired the shift verdict into the validation summary; refreshed plan/status/TODO/docs.
- 2026-03-10: Added canonical dynamics law, local causal theorems, and export wiring plus documentation updates to keep the Stage C summary accurate.
- 2026-03-10: Repo auditor confirmed canonical Stage C now exports dynamics and known-limits surfaces per the new spec/architecture, and the summary bundle references the refreshed theorems.
- 2026-03-10: Added KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem and re-exported it through the GR/QFT bridges so the canonical Stage C ladder now has a theorem-backed completion path for both gauge/matter and GR/QFT.
- 2026-03-10: Rewired canonical Stage C imports to use the grouped wave-regime wrappers and marked the TODO consolidation item complete.
- 2026-03-10: Rewired canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers to use recovery wave-regime wrappers; added a profile-rigidity aggregate report and exposed it in the validation summary; refreshed plan/TODO/status.
- 2026-03-10: Attempted autonomous orchestrator run; it failed due to blocked network access to the Codex backend.
- 2026-03-10: Added a formalized χ² boundary theorem wrapper and surfaced it in the validation summary; reprioritized TODO toward falsifiability and observable-collapse harness work.
