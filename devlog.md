# Devlog

- 2026-03-14: Changed closure-hygiene runner defaults so routine runs no
  longer spend hours draining aggregate summary targets after the leaf and
  intermediate modules are already green.
  - `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py` now skips learned `heavy` and
    `aggregator` tasks by default and exposes `--include-heavy` as the
    opt-in switch for aggregate integration runs.
  - `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh` now follows the same default/flag
    contract, preventing the Bash entrypoint from drifting from the Python
    runner.
  Validation:
  - `python3 scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py --help`: pass
  - `bash scripts/run_closure_hygiene.sh --help`: pass
  - `python3 scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py --discover-modules --class aggregator`:
    pass, no tasks selected
  - `python3 scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py --discover-modules --class aggregator --include-heavy`:
    pass, reports `DASHI/Everything.agda` and
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`
- 2026-03-14: Removed an unnecessary `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`
  dependency from the canonical ladder path.
  - `Canonical/LocalProgramBundle` now takes `closureStatus` directly from
  `CanonicalStageCStatus.canonicalProved` instead of importing the heavy
    validation summary only to read an alias.
  - Removed unused `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` imports from
    `PhysicsClosureSummary` and `Everything` so routine aggregate checks no
    longer force the 9-hour validation surface through the canonical bundle.
  Validation:
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda`: pass.
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`: pass.
  - `timeout 120s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124`, no type
    errors emitted before timeout.
- 2026-03-12: Completed `PhysicsClosureFull` canonical-derivation consolidation.
  Added `CanonicalExternalInputs` + builder
  `canonicalPhysicsClosureFullFromExternal` in `PhysicsClosureFull`, so
  contraction/quadratic/signature/constraint fields are theorem-derived by
  construction and only external inputs remain caller-supplied.
  Rewired `PhysicsClosureFullInstance` and `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` to
  use the new builder. Added
  `PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage` to bind full closure endpoint with
  canonical Clifford/spin/Dirac/even-wave bridges, and exported this package
  through `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`, and
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`.
  Checks passed:
  `PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage`,
  `PhysicsClosureFull`,
  `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`,
  `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull`,
  `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`.
- 2026-03-12: Tightened canonical export surfaces for path-derived constraint
  closure:
  - `CanonicalStageC` now exports
    `canonicalConstraintPathWitness` and
    `canonicalConstraintClosureFromPathTheorem`.
  - `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` now includes
    `constraintPathWitnessSummary` and
    `constraintClosureFromPathSummary`.
  - `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` now includes
    `constraintPathWitness` and
    `constraintClosureFromPath`.
  Targeted checks passed:
  `CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`.
- 2026-03-12: Completed the constraint-path cycle break and switched instance
  surfaces to path-derived closure:
  - Reworked `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem` to use a lightweight
    `CanonicalPathWitness` (`ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` +
    `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`) instead of importing
    `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` directly.
  - Switched
    `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`,
    `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull`,
    and `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed`
    to consume `canonicalPathInducedConstraintClosure`.
  - `CanonicalConstraintClosureWitness` remains path-derived.
  Checks:
  `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem`,
  `CanonicalConstraintClosureWitness`,
  `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` pass.
  `CanonicalStageC` reaches long-run path and times out under bounded check
  (`timeout 90s`, exit `124`) with no type errors emitted.
- 2026-03-12: Continued item 12/13/14 implementation with constraint/law
  surface hardening:
  - `CanonicalConstraintClosureWitness.closureWitness` now points to
    `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem.canonicalPathInducedConstraintClosure`
    (path-derived witness layer).
  - Kept full/assumed closure instances on
    `ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPackage.canonicalPackageInducedClosure`
    to avoid an import cycle caused by path theorem dependencies.
  - Added explicit law-status registry in `AxiomSet`
    (`LawStatus`, `AxiomLawSurfaceStatus`,
    `canonicalAxiomLawSurfaceStatus`) for canonical theorem/instance/assumption
    auditing.
  Validation:
  - `CanonicalStageC`: pass.
  - `Everything`: timed check hits runtime guardrail path
    (`PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) and exits `124` under 20s timeout.
- 2026-03-12: Started checklist item 12/13 derivation pass by threading
  canonical theorem-chain outputs into full-closure adapters:
  - `PhysicsClosureFull` now exports canonical bridge helpers
    (`canonicalContractionQuadraticTheorem`,
    `canonicalContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridge`).
  - `PhysicsClosureFullInstance` now takes `quadraticFormZ` from
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.derivedQuadratic` and takes
    `signature31Theorem`/`signature31` from
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
  - `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull` was rewired the same way.
  - `PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed` now consumes
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.signature31Theorem` on the
    canonical route instead of direct profile theorem symbol wiring.
  Validation passed, including a heavy check of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageC.agda`.
- 2026-03-12: Completed checklist item 9 (`DecimationToClifford`) by replacing
  abstract placeholders with explicit theorem interfaces:
  `CliffordRelations.rel` now states generator-square collapse from
  `Quadratic.Q` witnesses; added `TargetAlgebra`,
  `RelationRespectingMap`, and a stronger `UniversalClifford` carrying
  `include`, `factor`, `factorOnInclude`, and uniqueness seam fields.
  Updated `decimation⇒clifford` to construct this richer package.
  Targeted checks passed:
  `DecimationToClifford`,
  `UnificationClosure`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-12: Continued checklist execution for profile/signature selection
  front door hardening. Added constructor/symmetry helpers to
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfile`, introduced a canonical single-source
  profile pipeline record in `OrbitProfileExternal`
  (`CanonicalOrbitProfilePipeline` + canonical equalities), and rewired
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfileShiftInstance` to consume that pipeline and
  expose `shiftSignatureForced31` (signature uniqueness from measured profile
  equality). Targeted checks passed:
  `OrbitProfileExternal`,
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfile`,
  `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfileShiftInstance`,
  `Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-12: Began implementation execution from
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md` (Phase 1 hardening).
  Added representation-invariance/canonicality lemmas to
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`
  (`canonicalQuadraticAgreement`,
  `canonicalQuadraticAgreementToQ̂core`), added an explicit canonical
  output surface in `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`
  (`CanonicalQuadraticOutput`, `canonicalOutput`, `canonicalOutputAgreement`,
  `canonicalRealStackContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`), and threaded the
  canonical theorem object into
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
  Targeted checks passed:
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-12: Ran `get-shit-done` planning pass to convert the current
  all_code54-based closure roadmap into an execution-ready, module-mapped
  checklist with concrete theorem identifiers. Added
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md` and synchronized project
  memory (`plan.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`) to route next execution to
  `long-running-development` on that checklist.
- 2026-03-12: Tightened `Quadratic ⇒ Signature` from value witness to theorem
  lock by extending `CausalForcesLorentz31` with `LorentzSignatureLock`
  (witness/uniqueness/rival-rejection split), adding
  `lorentzSignatureLockFromCausalAxioms`, and threading theorem-bearing
  signature fields (`signature31Theorem`) through
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and `PhysicsClosureFull`.
- 2026-03-12: Strengthened
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` by replacing
  the raw universal seam placeholder with an explicit factorization interface
  (`TargetCarrier`, `factor`, and generator-compatibility witness). Rechecked
  `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`, and
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` successfully.
- 2026-03-12: Completed the local cleanup of
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda` by replacing
  passthrough dependencies on `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms` with direct local
  proofs for `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits`.
- 2026-03-12: Audited quadratic=>signature theorem dependencies and removed
  the remaining hidden profile prerequisite from intrinsic theorem
  construction by splitting
  `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` into
  core theorem axioms (`IntrinsicSignatureCoreAxioms`) and a separate
  profile witness package (`IntrinsicProfileWitness`), then rewiring
  `Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance` to supply those independently.
- 2026-03-11: Completed canonical `WaveLift⇒Even` bridge hardening as a
  downstream theorem from `Quadratic⇒Clifford`:
  - strengthened `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` with
    `CliffordGrading`, structural `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical `WaveLift`, and
    witness-bearing `WaveLiftIntoEven` factorization (`Σ e, lift s ≡ incl e`).
  - rewired `DASHI/Physics/ConcreteClosureStack.agda` so `q2cl` provides
    canonical multiplication/paired-word structure and `wl` provides
    grading/even/wave-lift/factorization witnesses by construction.
  - added
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda` as the
    dedicated canonical export for the
    `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`
    chain.
  - resolved one import-cycle regression by keeping
    `DASHI/Physics/WaveLiftEvenSubalgebra.agda` prototype-only and placing
    canonical closure exports in the new closure theorem module.
  - targeted checks passed:
    `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
    `ConcreteClosureStack`,
    `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
    `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
    `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`.
- 2026-03-11: Completed quadratic=>signature theorem-source hardening by adding
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda` (causal package + normalization
  seam + Lemma A/Lemma B split), rewiring
  `Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing` to use that theorem path as primary,
  keeping orbit-profile equality as a secondary certification surface, and
  preserving `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` consumer interface
  unchanged.
- 2026-03-11: Added
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda` as a
  canonical contraction-strong quadratic-to-Clifford theorem surface.
  It now carries normalized quadratic transport from
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`,
  a canonical bilinear-form builder from normalized quadratic data,
  a theorem-level `Quadratic⇒Clifford` builder, and an explicit
  universal-property seam.
  Also rewired
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` to export the new theorem
  package.
- 2026-03-11: Completed the contraction=>quadratic tightening pass on the
  canonical path by adding
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`, routing
  both `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem` and
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` through its canonical projection-defect
  package, and extending `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with explicit
  strength fields (`invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`,
  `compatibleWithIsotropy`) while keeping the signature bridge interface
  unchanged.
- 2026-03-11: Added
  `ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem` and threaded it through
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and
  `Everything`. This makes the contraction→signature seam consumable directly
  by spin/Lorentz and spin/Dirac surfaces without changing theorem strength.
- 2026-03-11: Ran targeted checks under a strict 2-minute timeout policy:
  the new bridge module typechecks; Stage-C bundle scope checks time out due to
  large dependency expansion (exit `124`) with no emitted type errors before
  timeout. Runtime guardrail on full
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` checks remains in force.
- 2026-03-11: Completed focused audit of orchestrator-generated edits and
  adopted them as baseline where compile-safe and aligned with the bottleneck
  path (notably Bool inversion witness + standalone B₄ snap-threshold harness).
  Kept `milestones_remaining = 1` because `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` is still open.
- 2026-03-11: Completed the cross-realization snap-threshold extension by
  adding a Bool inversion-specific witness module
  (`Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness`), rewiring
  `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` to consume it, adding a standalone
  `SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4` harness, and exporting the new B₄ verdict
  through `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`.
- 2026-03-11: Added
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` and exported it through
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, and `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`.
  This makes the strengthened contraction path a first-class signature bridge
  surface while keeping uniqueness-up-to-scale explicitly pending.
- 2026-03-11: Added a runtime guardrail note in project memory to skip
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` routine checks until runtime bounds
  are acceptable; current observed bound is ~1.25h.
- 2026-03-11: Exported a canonical nontrivial strengthened contraction witness
  across Stage C surfaces (`CanonicalStageC`,
  `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`,
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) via
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.canonicalNontrivialInvariantStrong`.
- 2026-03-11: Ran autonomous orchestrator once; it selected
  `long-running-development` and exited with code `1` due blocked network
  access to `chatgpt.com` Codex/MCP endpoints in this environment.
- 2026-03-11: Added `canonicalSignedPerm4InvariantStrong` in
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`, wiring the first nontrivial quadratic
  invariant witness (`Signature31InstanceShiftZ.qcore-pres4`) through the
  strengthened contraction path.
- 2026-03-11: Strengthened `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` with a concrete
  invariant witness field (`invariantQuadraticWitness`) and added
  `canonicalIdentityInvariantStrong` as the first non-placeholder witness
  instance while keeping `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` explicitly open.
- 2026-03-10: Re-baselined Stage-C status after audit: downgraded the previous
  "five-pillar complete" wording to "packaging complete, bottleneck proof
  still open". Added two bottleneck modules:
  `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram` and
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`, where the remaining
  invariant/uniqueness obligations are explicit seams.
- 2026-03-10: Added `PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem` and threaded it through
  canonical Stage C exports (`CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, and `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`) so the
  five target milestones are represented as one explicit theorem package:
  natural dynamics law, conserved quantity, continuum limit,
  realization-independent proof, and full gauge/matter recovery theorem.
- 2026-03-10: Replaced the provisional non-shift synthetic-bool snap-threshold harness with a synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`, proxy policy), rewired `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` and `Everything` to consume it, and updated plan/TODO/status/docs to track the cross-realization validation package as in progress.
- 2026-03-10: Added a synthetic one-minus non-shift snap policy derived from the witness state type and a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the shift snap witness), updated validation exports, and retargeted the next snap-threshold step to the Bool inversion witness + B₄ harness.
- 2026-03-10: Bug-hunter cycle: reproduced `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` failure (exit 42), fixed exported alias collisions in wave-regime consumers (`KLRWOTGRC`, `KLRWOTGRCOMP`) by making them private, then fixed a `rigidityAggregate` multiple-definition collision in `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` by switching `RealizationProfileRigidityShift` to a qualified import; targeted scope-check now passes, while full typechecks were cut short by runtime limits in this environment.
- 2026-03-10: Added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a provisional non-shift validation placeholder.
- 2026-03-10: Documented the condensed priority roadmap and the non-shift snap-threshold prerequisite so the next validation step is explicit.
- 2026-03-10: Fixed a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open import and keeping explicit aliases; kicked off a recheck of the module.
- 2026-03-10: Expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and added a tertiary snap-threshold harness wired into the validation summary.
- 2026-03-10: Added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- 2026-03-10: Added preferred harness/dataset column to the forward prediction validation table and marked the TODO item complete.
- 2026-03-10: Extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the shift reference with a secondary shift-side boundary case, wired the verdict into the validation summary, and refreshed docs/plan/TODO/status/changelog.
- 2026-03-10: Added a falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report (mirror-signature exclusion and competing 4D profile failures) and wired the shift verdict into the validation summary; refreshed plan/status/TODO/docs.
- 2026-03-10: Added canonical dynamics law, local causal theorems, and export wiring plus documentation updates to keep the Stage C summary accurate.
- 2026-03-10: Repo auditor confirmed canonical Stage C now exports dynamics and known-limits surfaces per the new spec/architecture, and the summary bundle references the refreshed theorems.
- 2026-03-10: Added KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem and re-exported it through the GR/QFT bridges so the canonical Stage C ladder now has a theorem-backed completion path for both gauge/matter and GR/QFT.
- 2026-03-10: Rewired canonical Stage C imports to use the grouped wave-regime wrappers and marked the TODO consolidation item complete.
- 2026-03-10: Rewired canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers to use recovery wave-regime wrappers; added a profile-rigidity aggregate report and exposed it in the validation summary; refreshed plan/TODO/status.
- 2026-03-10: Attempted autonomous orchestrator run; it failed due to blocked network access to the Codex backend.
- 2026-03-10: Added a formalized χ² boundary theorem wrapper and surfaced it in the validation summary; reprioritized TODO toward falsifiability and observable-collapse harness work.
- 2026-03-11: Ran `get-shit-done` planning pass focused on proof-graph simplification. Set a single canonical closure spine (`ProjectionDefect → EnergySplitProof → Parallelogram → QuadraticForm → ConeTimeIsotropy → Signature31FromConeArrowIsotropy → Signature31Lock`), added route classification policy (`canonical` / `alternative` / `validation` / `experimental`), and rerouted project memory to treat parallel quadratic/signature emergence modules as non-canonical derivation checks.
- 2026-03-11: Long-running-development execution pass for the Stage C spine simplification. Updated contraction theorem surfaces to expose projection→parallelogram packages instead of raw emergence axioms (`ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`, `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`), hardened uniqueness transport in `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`, aligned `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem` with the updated uniqueness accessor, added explicit non-canonical route annotations to the parallel quadratic modules, and refreshed `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` to the `canonical/alternative/validation/experimental` taxonomy with a canonical `QuadraticForm` node. Targeted Agda checks passed for canonical Stage C and both theorem/summary bundles.
- 2026-03-11: Completed direct Stage C-facing import sweep off `QuadraticFormEmergence` for full-closure adapters. Reworked `PhysicsClosureFull` to accept `ProjectionDefectParallelogramPackage` on `metricEmergence`, and rewired `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`, `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalToFull`, and `PhysicsClosureFullShiftInstance` to construct quadratics via `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.quadraticFromProjectionDefect`. Verified with targeted checks plus canonical Stage C + theorem/summary bundles.
- 2026-03-11: Added package-first shift helpers in `QuadraticEmergenceShiftInstance` (`projectionParallelogramShift`, `quadraticShiftΣ`, `quadraticShift`) and rewired `Signature31InstanceShiftZ` to consume them instead of importing `QuadraticFormEmergence` directly. Targeted module checks pass. A full `CanonicalStageC` recheck is currently blocked by an unrelated sort mismatch in `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` (`Set₂` vs `Set₁`).
- 2026-03-11: Completed the canonical import sweep in Stage-C-facing surfaces. Added `DASHI/Geometry/QuadraticCanonical.agda` as a canonical re-export entrypoint; added canonical-boundary comments to projection/quadratic and contraction/signature bridge modules; and confirmed no direct imports of alternate quadratic geometry modules in `Closure`/`Signature`/`Unification` surfaces. Verified `CanonicalStageC` and `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle` typecheck after the sweep.
- 2026-03-11: Follow-up compatibility pass after deeper validation-summary rechecks. Restored `localCoherenceSummary` in `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and rewired it from canonical local-coherence theorem surface; renamed `SignatureClassificationBridge.Signature` to `SignatureClassification` to resolve namespace ambiguity; propagated that rename into `CanonicalContractionQuadraticSignatureBridgeTheorem`; rechecked canonical Stage C + theorem/summary bundles successfully. `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` now progresses past prior scope failures but still exceeds a 300s bounded run.
