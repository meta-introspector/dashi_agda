## Repository Status

Current theorem status:

- Stage A is complete: the orbit-profile discriminant selects Lorentz signature
  `(3,1)` in the current 4D framework.
- Stage B is complete for the current finite 4D realization: the
  cone/arrow/isotropy stack now drives shell enumeration through abstract
  interfaces rather than a shift-specific proof source.
- Stage C is still open: the current target is **minimal credible physics
  closure**, meaning a theorem-backed dynamics package plus an
  observable-consequence package for the same 4D framework. That package must
  distinguish what is already proved from what is only a forward prediction
  claim. The next concrete benchmark is profile rigidity across new 4D
  realizations.
- Current validation snapshot:
  reference signed-permutation self-check = `exactMatch`,
  synthetic one-minus admissible candidate = `exactMatch`,
  Bool inversion secondary admissible candidate = `signatureOnlyMatch`,
  tail-permutation negative control = `mismatch`.
- Preferred next realization target:
  a Coxeter / Weyl-style 4D shell-orbit realization, beginning with an
  independent `B₄` shell/profile report and later promoted into the admissible
  harness only if its shell class becomes Lorentz-compatible and
  orientation/signature are justified.
- New Lorentz-neighborhood shell-side comparison:
  an independent synthetic one-minus-family candidate now matches the shift
  shell-1 and shell-2 profiles exactly and now serves as the canonical
  admissible alternate realization on the current Stage C path.
- New Lorentz-neighborhood dynamic search surface:
  a typed synthetic dynamics witness and a minimal independent-dynamics
  candidate now exist so the search for a second Lorentz-family realization
  is no longer shell-only.
- New synthetic-promotion status surface:
  the repo now records the exact blocker between the synthetic profile-aware
  candidate and admissible-harness promotion, instead of leaving that gap
  implicit.
- Synthetic promotion status is now complete on the current path:
  orientation and signature are bridged, a minimal independent-dynamics
  witness is present, and the synthetic one-minus candidate now enters the
  admissible rigidity harness.
- Stronger dynamics baseline:
  the canonical shift dynamics package now carries an explicit status object
  for propagation, causal admissibility, monotone quantity, and effective
  geometry, plus a semantics-bearing dynamics witness companion exported on
  the canonical path.
- New closure runway status surfaces:
  the canonical Stage C path now exports a concrete minimal
  constraint-closure status and a known-limits status surface so broader
  physics work can be staged without overstating recovery.
- New closure runway witnesses:
  the canonical Stage C path now also exports a first known-limits recovery
  witness and a witness-bearing spin/Dirac consumer surface.
- New closure runway theorem surfaces:
  the canonical Stage C path now also exports a concrete minimal
  constraint-closure witness and a stronger known-limits recovery witness that
  carries actual propagation and effective-geometry witnesses, not only status
  tags.
- New closure runway theorem slices:
  the canonical Stage C path now also exports:
  a minimal algebraic-closure theorem for the concrete three-generator system,
  a scoped known-limits local-recovery theorem for the current local
  Lorentz + propagation slice,
  and a scoped effective-geometry theorem for the same local recovery regime.
- Next canonical runway theorem slices:
  a scoped gauge-contract theorem on top of the canonical concrete closure
  baseline,
  and a scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem on top of the local recovery
  and effective-geometry baseline.
- Those two scoped runway theorems now live on the canonical Stage C path.
- The current widening beyond those scoped slices is now landed:
  a carrier-parametric gauge/constraint theorem with the current concrete
  carrier as its first instance, plus a second realized carrier instance,
  and a local causal-effective propagation theorem with a further local
  geometry-transport theorem on the current recovery baseline.
- Next widening step:
  a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem on top of the current
  carrier-parametric theorem, and a local causal-geometry coherence theorem
  above the transport slice.
- Those widening slices are now landed.
  Current newest physics-first widening is also landed:
  a stronger local recovery theorem beyond the current coherence slice,
  plus a stronger algebraic-coherence theorem beyond the current
  package-parametric bridge.
- That next physics-first widening is now landed:
  one stronger local recovered-regime theorem on top of the current local
  physics coherence slice,
  and one stronger algebraic-stability theorem on top of the current
  algebraic-coherence slice.
- That next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-dynamics theorem above the current complete-local
  regime slice,
  one stronger algebraic-consistency theorem above the current
  algebraic-bundle/stability slice,
  one geometry-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical ladder,
  and one richer moonshine comparison bundle on the prototype track.
- Current next physics-first cycle:
  one stronger recovered-wave-geometry theorem above the current
  recovered-wavefront slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-invariance theorem above the current
  transport-invariance slice,
  one wave-geometry-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave family summary on the prototype track.
- Next algebraic milestone:
  add a finite orbit-shell generating series for the current shift profile,
  then use it for standalone `B₄` comparison and a prototype wave lift.
- Safe symmetry-interpretation order:
  treat the current orbit profile as living first in a
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like neighborhood;
  only ask Niemeier/umbral-style questions if a genuine root-lattice shell
  realization appears;
  reserve Monster/Moonshine language for a future graded-module / trace bridge.
- Current moonshine-facing prototype:
  finite graded shell series and twined fixed-point traces are now present for
  the shift signed action and the standalone `B₄` Weyl action; the wave lift
  remains a prototype grading adapter rather than a theorem-bearing trace
  module.
  Richer twiner libraries and a first graded/twined comparison report surface
  are now landed.
  A richer comparison bundle now sits over the existing detailed report and
  wave summary while staying pre-moonshine and non-modular.
- Next theorem milestone:
  the bounded one-minus shell family is now the base layer and the parametric
  shell-1 theorem is now in place; the next theorem milestone is a second
  Lorentz-family realization and stronger shell-2 / orientation follow-through.
- Current closure hardening target:
  keep the canonical Stage C path, the empirical full adapter, and the legacy
  assumed closure surface on the same concrete constraint-closure witness, and
  keep the canonical Stage C entrypoint explicit in code rather than only in
  summary prose.
- Next runnable benchmark:
  Fejér-over-χ² monotonicity, starting from a typed shift reference harness
  with theorem-backed Fejér / closest-point / MDL witnesses and an explicit
  χ² falsifier-status boundary.
- Newly landed benchmark surface:
  observable-space collapse is now exposed as a typed shift benchmark backed
  by the observable fixed-point and uniqueness witnesses in the real closure
  kit.
- Current Fejér benchmark snapshot:
  positive side established and carried directly by the benchmark harness,
  χ² side now has a concrete shift-side boundary witness,
  that witness now sits inside a small explicit shift-side boundary library,
  and the standalone snap-threshold benchmark is now exposed as its own typed
  validation surface.

The repo does **not** currently claim full physics closure or “solved
physics”.

# I. State Space 

### 1. Carrier

[
T = {-1, 0, +1}
]

Interpretation:

* (+1) = constructive / help
* (0) = neutral / indeterminate

---

### 2. 3×3 Reasoning Tensor

[
S \in T^{L \times \tau}
]

Where:

**Lenses**
[
L = {3,6,9}
]

* 3 = Self

]

This is the full virtual state sheet.

# II. Extracted Invariants

The supervisor does **not** reason over all 19,683 states directly.

It extracts an invariant tuple:

[
I(S) = (b_0, \sigma, \Delta_m, T, Z)
]

---

## 1. Present Backbone

[
b_0 = (S_{3,0}, S_{6,0}, S_{9,0}) \in T^3
]

This is the “spine”.

---

## 2. Temporal Instability per lens

[
\sigma_\ell = #{t_i \neq t_{i+1}}
]

Total instability:

[
\sigma = \sigma_3 + \sigma_6 + \sigma_9
]

---

## 3. Mirror Asymmetry

[
\Delta_m = \sum_{t \in \tau}
\mathbf{1}[S_{9,t} \neq \text{mirror_check}(S_{*,t})]
]

Measures conjugation failure.

---

## 4. Tension Mass

[
T = #(+) \cdot #(-)
]

High when help/harm coexist strongly.

---

## 5. Neutral Load

[
Z = #(0)
]

Tracks indeterminacy.

# IV. Topological Interpretation (Optional Layer)

You can interpret motifs as equivalence classes under symmetry:

[
G = S_3^{time} \times C_2^{mirror}
]

Motifs are orbits in quotient:

[
T^9 / G
]

Examples:

| Motif | Geometry        |
| ----- | --------------- |
| M1    | Stable sink     |
| M5    | Saddle          |
| M7    | Spiral          |
| M9    | Absorbing basin |

This is explanatory, not required for classification.

---

# V. M10 – Voxel Overflow

M10 is not a motif in the same equivalence class.

It is a **resolution jump**.

Define capacity:

[
C = 9
]

Overflow trigger:

[
Z + T > C
]

Interpretation:
Local invariant compression insufficient.

Operation:
Lift

[
T^9 \to T^{9} \times T
]

i.e., introduce new coordinate axis.

This is a carry operation (p-adic style).

Result:
New voxel.

---

# VI. Structural Summary
