## Repository Status

Current theorem status:

- Stage A is complete: the orbit-profile discriminant selects Lorentz signature
  `(3,1)` in the current 4D framework.
- Stage B is complete for the current finite 4D realization: the
  cone/arrow/isotropy stack now drives shell enumeration through abstract
  interfaces rather than a shift-specific proof source.
- Stage C is still open: the current target is **minimal credible physics
  closure**, meaning a theorem-backed dynamics package plus an
  observable-consequence package for the same 4D framework. That package must
  distinguish what is already proved from what is only a forward prediction
  claim. The next concrete benchmark is profile rigidity across new 4D
  realizations.

The repo does **not** currently claim full physics closure or “solved
physics”.

For the current forward-claim shortlist and falsifiability criteria, see
`Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`.
For the current milestone order, see `Docs/PhysicsClosurePriorities.md`.

# I. State Space 

### 1. Carrier

Let

[
T = {-1, 0, +1}
]

Interpretation:

* (+1) = constructive / help
* (0) = neutral / indeterminate
* (-1) = destructive / harm

---

### 2. 3×3 Reasoning Tensor

[
S \in T^{L \times \tau}
]

Where:

**Lenses**
[
L = {3,6,9}
]

* 3 = Self
* 6 = Norm
* 9 = Mirror

**Temporal gates**
[
\tau = {p,0,f}
]

* p = past
* 0 = present
* f = future

Cardinality:

[
|T^{9}| = 3^9 = 19,683
]

This is the full virtual state sheet.

---

# II. Extracted Invariants

The supervisor does **not** reason over all 19,683 states directly.

It extracts an invariant tuple:

[
I(S) = (b_0, \sigma, \Delta_m, T, Z)
]

---

## 1. Present Backbone

[
b_0 = (S_{3,0}, S_{6,0}, S_{9,0}) \in T^3
]

This is the “spine”.

---

## 2. Temporal Instability per lens

[
\sigma_\ell = #{t_i \neq t_{i+1}}
]

Total instability:

[
\sigma = \sigma_3 + \sigma_6 + \sigma_9
]

---

## 3. Mirror Asymmetry

[
\Delta_m = \sum_{t \in \tau}
\mathbf{1}[S_{9,t} \neq \text{mirror_check}(S_{*,t})]
]

Measures conjugation failure.

---

## 4. Tension Mass

[
T = #(+) \cdot #(-)
]

High when help/harm coexist strongly.

---

## 5. Neutral Load

[
Z = #(0)
]

Tracks indeterminacy.

---

# III. Deterministic Motif Classifier

Define

[
\mathcal{M} : T^9 \to {M_1,\dots,M_9}
]

Ordered by priority rules.

---

## M1 – Robust Allow

Condition:

* (b_0 = (+,+,+))
* (\sigma = 0)
* (\Delta_m = 0)

Interpretation:
Full constructive interference.

Action:
Allow.

---

## M2 – Time-Gated Allow

Condition:

* (S_{3,0}=+)
* (S_{6,0}=+)
* (S_{9,0}=+)
* (S_{9,f} = -)

Interpretation:
Future instability only.

Action:
Add timing fence.

---

## M3 – Role-Gated

Condition:

* (S_{3,0}=+)
* (S_{9,0}=+)
* (S_{6,0}=-)

Interpretation:
Norm conflict only.

Action:
Restrict by role.

---

## M4 – Substrate Fail

Condition:

* (S_{6,0} \ge 0)
* (S_{9,0} \ge 0)
* (S_{3,0} \le 0)

Interpretation:
Externally coherent but locally harmful.

Action:
Redesign substrate.

---

## M5 – Mirror-Unstable

Condition:

* (S_{3,0}=+)
* (S_{6,0}=+)
* (S_{9,0}=-)

Interpretation:
Present looks fine but fails reflection.

Action:
Buffer. Do not generalize.

---

## M6 – Redesign Lane

Condition:

* (b_0 = (-,-,-)) OR strongly negative present
* but ∃ t ∈ {p,f} s.t. (S_{9,t} = +)

Interpretation:
Non-local constructive path exists.

Action:
Reframe (dose/time/product).

---

## M7 – Tolerance Rim

Condition:

* (S_{3,0}=+)
* but (\sigma) large
* flips toward negative over time

Interpretation:
Dynamical fatigue.

Action:
Frequency control.

---

## M8 – Programmatic Only

Condition:

* Sparse positive occupancy
* Most entries negative

Interpretation:
Filamentary viability only.

Action:
Structured program only.

---

## M9 – Retire / Prohibit

Condition:

[
b_0 = (-,-,-)
]

Interpretation:
All-red spine.

Action:
Disallow.

---

# IV. Topological Interpretation (Optional Layer)

You can interpret motifs as equivalence classes under symmetry:

[
G = S_3^{time} \times C_2^{mirror}
]

Motifs are orbits in quotient:

[
T^9 / G
]

Examples:

| Motif | Geometry        |
| ----- | --------------- |
| M1    | Stable sink     |
| M5    | Saddle          |
| M7    | Spiral          |
| M9    | Absorbing basin |

This is explanatory, not required for classification.

---

# V. M10 – Voxel Overflow

M10 is not a motif in the same equivalence class.

It is a **resolution jump**.

Define capacity:

[
C = 9
]

Overflow trigger:

[
Z + T > C
]

Interpretation:
Local invariant compression insufficient.

Operation:
Lift

[
T^9 \to T^{9} \times T
]

i.e., introduce new coordinate axis.

This is a carry operation (p-adic style).

Result:
New voxel.

---

# VI. Structural Summary

You now have:

* Finite state space (3^9)
* Deterministic invariant extraction
* Deterministic classification
* Explicit overflow rule
* No metaphors required
