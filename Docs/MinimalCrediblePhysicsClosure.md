# Minimal Credible Physics Closure

## Headline

In this repo, "minimal credible physics closure" means:

- the 4D signature theorem is already in place,
- the closure stack carries a real dynamical package rather than only loose
  closure ingredients,
- the same closure stack also exposes observable consequences and forward
  prediction claims,
- the repo distinguishes clearly between:
  - what is formally proved,
  - what is supported by empirical/evidence modules,
  - what is currently only a prediction or deviation claim.

It does **not** mean:

- full GR/QFT recovery,
- solved physics,
- realization-independent closure beyond the current 4D framework,
- Monster/Moonshine or other deep symmetry closure.

## Stronger Archive Support, Same Open Gaps

Recent archive and sibling-repo crosswalk work sharpens the status without
changing the claim boundary.

Stronger than before:

- state-tensor formalisation now gives a more explicit gauge-covariant /
  chiral / holonomy-facing wave language,
- the physics-closure archive material now gives a more explicit candidate
  route through minimal axioms, contractive stack, canonical Dirac-operator
  language, and finite `R/C/H` algebra pruning,
- quotient dynamics are more clearly scaffolded through `K = C ∘ P ∘ R`,
  fiberwise contraction, ultrametric quotient structure, and invariant tuples.

Still genuinely open:

- a natural physical dynamics law,
- a conserved physical quantity with clear physical interpretation,
- an explicit continuum-limit theorem,
- a realization-independent proof,
- full gauge/matter recovery as theorem rather than derivation program.

## Measurement Discipline

For symmetry-adjacent anomaly reports and proof-corpus comparisons, keep the
structural and dynamical questions separate.

- JMD-side questions are classification/section questions:
  regime occupancy, invariant slots, ERDFA-style metadata, and basin labels
  such as `eigenspace`, `bott`, `Hecke`, `orbifold`, `DA51`, and `j-fixed`.
- DASHI-side questions are trajectory/dynamics questions:
  `Δx`, cone compatibility, contraction/Fejér behavior, closest-point style
  witnesses, and source-vs-trace admissibility.
- Current archive-backed conclusion:
  the DA51 / exponent-vector embedding can detect a shared rigid structural
  shell, but it does not currently separate Monster-labeled proofs as a class.
- Local tooling discipline for merge-prep work:
  when sibling-repo or upstream changes add Nix/zkperf/demo-witness surfaces,
  treat them as acceptable only if the authoritative closure check still runs
  through `DASHI/Everything.agda` and any recursive smoke/record surface
  actually includes nested `Kernel/`, `Monster/`, and `Verification/`
  modules rather than only top-level files.
- Therefore:
  do not treat global cosine/L2 proximity or `p47` stability alone as a
  Monster-specific signal.
  Use regime-distribution tests for the JMD side and delta-regime / cone tests
  for the DASHI side.
- Current bridge status:
  the repo now also carries an explicit execution-admissibility witness layer
  for the checked `dashifine` trace family.
  On the current strict-profile export that witness classifies the checked
  steps as `56` `Interior` plus `4` `ArrowBoundary`, with no structural or
  outside-class escapes.
- Source-side bridge status:
  the explicit DASL / Monster source grammar now used for bridge planning sits
  in the sibling repo `../kant-zk-pastebin`, where the `0xDA51` address space,
  orbifold coordinates, `EigenSpace`, and Bott/Hecke metadata are made
  explicit.
  A separate Lean-side sibling check now clarifies the contrast:
  `../dashi_lean4` is useful as a DA51/moonshine/schema witness, but it does
  not provide the missing JMD class/projection layer.
  In particular it does not add a DASL address grammar, explicit
  `Earth/Spoke/Hub/Clock` eigenspace table, or Bott/Hecke/orbifold class table
  for the HEPData family projection problem.
  That source anchor is enough to justify first-pass source-backed
  `Basin` / `Eigen` predicates in the local harness, but not yet enough to
  claim a realized class-projection theorem or automatic `p47` preservation.
  In the current artifacts, `basin_ok` therefore means support under the parsed
  DASL eigenspace prior rather than a full class-level source projection;
  the explicit runtime/export alias for that is `source_support_ok`.
  The artifacts also now separate the conservative canonical source projection
  from an explicit scored-primary experimental mode, so bridge-facing claims can
  stay pinned to the canonical surface while ranking-led experiments remain
  inspectable.
  A `projection_conflict` marker now makes any divergence between those two
  source representatives explicit, without upgrading that divergence into a
  source/execution failure claim.
  The scored ranking layer is also now canonical-anchored and its exported
  top-k candidates are marked as diagnostic shortlist data, not as a promoted
  projection theorem.
  The same artifacts now expose the score components behind those rankings,
  which makes the remaining source-side heuristic surface inspectable rather
  than black-box.
  The next local refinement path is therefore straightforward: enrich those
  components with more source metadata such as `Hecke`/`Bott`, and check that
  the resulting bridge behavior remains stable across more than one compatible
  trace batch.
  That broader check is now in place for the currently available `dashifine`
  trace batches: source-side support/projection remains stable, while the only
  new instability appears on the execution side as additional arrow-boundary
  families in the larger trace sets.
  The local harness now exposes those families directly, which means the next
  closure-hardening work is not generic cone tuning but targeted handling of
  the current outliers, especially `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`.
  The current focused read on that family is a late mixed-axis reversal rather
  than a diffuse loss of structural admissibility.
  A tighter terminal-step autopsy now also records raw and transformed
  `v_dnorm` behavior for that family.
  On the current larger-batch run, the two terminal `v_dnorm` reversals remain
  positive under raw, log-absolute, robust-z, winsorized, and family-minmax
  views, but only at near-zero scale.
  The same export now also records raw observable context:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is a `7`-bin spectrum, its last bin (`x≈1350`) has the
  largest fractional uncertainty (`~8.19%`), and the first failing step lands
  on the late `alpha=1e4 -> 1e5` jump.
  That family classification is now reflected in the Agda witness layer too:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentFamilyWitness.agda` exports
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` as `MDLTailBoundaryFamily`, and the family witness is
  threaded through `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness` with an authoritative accessor
  from `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure`.
  The sibling-repo witness reports further narrow the interpretation:
  that same family still satisfies the closest-point and Fejér-set summaries
  (`closestpoint_frac=1.0`, `fejer_set_frac=1.0`), while the explicit local
  exception is confined to the MDL-exact descent surface.
  So the current disciplined reading is still “late tail/edge-sensitive
  stiffness in the representation or analysis layer,” specifically on the
  MDL-style exact descent view, not “structural cone falsified.”
  The local family-summary layer now reflects that distinction directly:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is classified as `mdl_tail_boundary` rather than only
  as a generic mixed hard-axis outlier, while the step-level witness remains
  the smaller `ArrowBoundary` class.
  The same current-witness statement now has a dedicated Agda surface in
  `TailBoundaryLemma.agda`.
  In the current larger-trace family set the empirical count is still narrow:
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_lemma_latest.json` reports
  `1` `mdl_tail_boundary` family out of `9`, and that present case is both
  tail-localized and terminal-boundary by the local summary rule.
  The widened three-batch aggregate is still narrow in the same direction:
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_batch_latest.json` reports
  `2` `mdl_tail_boundary` instances across `3` currently compatible datasets,
  but still only one unique family (`ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`).
  In both observed instances the family remains cone / Fejér / closest-point
  admissible, MDL-exact-failing, tail-localized, and terminal-boundary.
  That same aggregate also now makes the controls explicit:
  repeated `pTll` families plus `dijet_chi_7tev_cms` and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas` stay interior,
  `phistar_50_76` repeats only as `arrow_ladder`,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` repeats only as `single_arrow_break`,
  and only `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` repeats as `mdl_tail_boundary`.
  It also bounds the current local search space:
  there are only `3` compatible step files in `dashifine` at present.
  Among the current `7` tail-candidate families, only
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` leave the interior, which makes
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` the next local tail candidate after `ttbar`, followed by
  the still-interior heavy-spectrum candidates
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev`, `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev`,
  `dijet_chi_13tev_cms_mgt6`, `dijet_chi_7tev_cms`, and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas`.
  The focused `z_pt_7tev_atlas` export now makes that candidate more precise:
  it is still only a `single_arrow_break`, not a second `mdl_tail_boundary`.
  On the current run it has one late tail-localized boundary step at
  `t=9->10` with `arrow_delta≈0.0305551`, no non-arrow failure, all tested
  `v_dnorm` variants nonincreasing, and it clears under the `lenient` arrow
  profile.
  The first still-interior heavy-spectrum candidate is now checked too:
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev` stays fully interior on the same all-batch run.
  Current focused read:
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
  The next heavy-spectrum control `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev` is now checked too and
  stays fully interior under the same criteria:
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
  On the current checked `dashifine` trace family, the first source-backed pass
  leaves the step-class result unchanged.
  After refining the trace-side eigenspace heuristic and exporting both legacy
  and refined labels side by side, the previously localized
  `pTll_76_106` mismatch disappears:
  that family now reads as refined `Spoke` rather than legacy `Hub`, and the
  current source-support proxy clears the checked five-trace family.
  The source-side loader is now also richer:
  the current default source mode uses the full `15`-prime Monster catalog
  rather than only the encoding subset, so `source_support_ok` is now checked
  against a source model carrying explicit `Earth/Spoke/Hub/Clock` support.
  The harness now also emits a canonical source-projection proxy:
  match the refined trace eigenspace to the current source catalog and choose
  the highest-exponent prime in that class.
  On the checked traces this currently sends Earth-family traces to `p2`
  and the refined `Spoke` family to `p17`.
  The harness now also emits a scored source-prime ranking shortlist.
  On the checked `Spoke` family that shortlist currently ranks `p59` and `p71`
  above canonical `p17`, so the source-side picture now distinguishes between
  a conservative canonical proxy and a richer but still heuristic ranking
  surface.

## Minimum Acceptance Boundary

The minimum target is reached only when all of the following are true:

1. the signature input to the full closure comes from the current intrinsic
   `(3,1)` theorem path,
2. the full closure carries a real shift dynamics package with:
   - Fejer/closest-point seams,
   - MDL Lyapunov witness,
   - shift seam certificates,
3. the repo exposes a single observable-consequence package for the current
   shift framework,
4. that package distinguishes:
   - proved outputs,
   - excluded alternatives,
   - forward prediction claims,
5. downstream consumers such as the spin/Dirac gate depend on theorem-backed
   closure data rather than only type-level metric access.

## Parallel Tracks

### Track T — Theorem and Dynamics

This track upgrades the current closure from "signature + wiring" to
"signature + dynamics".

Current priorities:

- remove trivial placeholders from the minimum closure path,
- keep the canonical closure path and empirical full adapter on the same
  concrete constraint-closure witness,
- bundle the real shift Lyapunov and seam certificates as a dynamics package,
- expose an explicit dynamics-status surface for propagation, causal
  admissibility, monotone quantity, and effective geometry,
- add a semantics-bearing dynamics witness companion for the canonical shift
  path,
- export a concrete canonical constraint-closure status surface,
- export a known-limits status surface for the broader physics runway,
- feed full-closure instances from the intrinsic signature theorem,
- make downstream closure consumers depend on that package.

### Track E — Observables and Forward Predictions

This track upgrades the empirical side from separate evidence modules to a
single observable boundary.

Current priorities:

- package orbit/signature, MDL/Fejer, and seam evidence together,
- split that boundary into:
  - proved outputs:
    exact orientation-tag, shell-1 profile, shell-2 profile, and `(3,1)`
    profile match,
  - excluded alternatives:
    failure of the other 4D candidate signatures,
  - forward prediction claims:
    profile rigidity across new realizations,
    Fejer-over-χ² monotonicity,
    observable-space collapse,
    snap-threshold transition laws,
- state a falsifiability/deviation boundary for the framework.
- immediate validation hardening:
  move the Fejér-over-χ² reference from `interfaceWired` to a concrete
  shift-side χ²-boundary witness, and extend the standalone snap-threshold law
  benchmark beyond the reference witness with a second boundary case from the
  same severity/snap policy layer.

## Forward Prediction Table

These are **not** current theorem outputs. They are forward claims suggested by
the present closure stack and should be tested on new realizations, datasets,
or regimes.

| Claim | Source modules | Confidence | What would falsify it | Preferred test harness / dataset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile rigidity across new realizations | `Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile`, `ConeArrowIsotropyShiftOrbitEnumeration` | High | A new 4D realization preserving the same cone/arrow/isotropy structure produces a different shell-profile class or fails to select `(3,1)`. | `RealizationProfileRigidityShift` harness with admissible realizations (synthetic one-minus, Bool inversion, and future `B₄`). |
| Fejér-over-χ² monotonicity | `ShiftSeamCertificates`, `EnergyClosestPointShiftInstance`, `MDLFejerAxiomsShift` | High | A compatible shift-like regime shows persistent χ²-style improvement while Fejér/MDL observables lose monotonicity or closest-point behavior. | `FejerOverChiSquaredShift` harness plus χ² boundary library cases. |
| Observable-space collapse | `RealClosureKitFiber`, `DynamicalClosureShiftInstance` | High | Distinct microstates in the same observable quotient fail to converge to the same observable endpoint in the closure-compatible regime. | `ObservableCollapseShift` harness from `RealClosureKitFiber.obsFixed`/`obsUnique`. |
| Snap-threshold transition law | `SnapSignatureShiftInstance`, `RealConeMonotoneExceptSnapsShift`, `SeverityGuard*` modules, `SnapThresholdLawShift`, `SnapThresholdLawShiftSecondary`, `SnapThresholdLawShiftTertiary`, `SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`, `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` (proxy witness) | Medium | Regime changes occur diffusely rather than clustering at snap/severity threshold events. | `SnapThresholdLawShift` + `SnapThresholdLawShiftSecondary` + `SnapThresholdLawShiftTertiary` + `SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus` + `SnapThresholdLawBoolInversion` harnesses. |
| Witness-policy robustness | `WitnessSetPolicy`, `EmpiricalClosureWithWitnessPolicy`, `EmpiricalClosureWithSignatureLock` | Medium | Admissible witness-policy changes alter the final signature/closure classification rather than only efficiency or convergence behavior. | Witness-policy perturbation harness (pending) on `EmpiricalClosureWithWitnessPolicy`. |
| Cone-split persistence | `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalWithConeSplit`, `ArrowSeparatedDeltaConeSplit*`, `MaskedOrthogonalSplit` | Medium | New compatible datasets fail to preserve near-zero cross terms or stable quadratic split structure. | `MaskedOrthogonalSplit` empirical gate + cone-split CSV evidence runs. |
| Beta-seam universality | `BetaSeamCertificates*`, `BetaSeamCSVEvidence`, `PhysicsClosureEmpiricalBetaInstance` | Medium | Two seam bundles satisfying the same certificate interface lead to incompatible closure observables. | `BetaSeamCSVEvidence` dataset / certificate replay. |
| Defect-density / curvature correlation | `DefectDensityCurvature`, `EinsteinFromDefect` | Low | Persistent defect concentration shows no correlation with effective curvature concentration in the intended closure regime. | Defect-density curvature CSV/replay harness (pending). |
| Area-law style admissible-state growth | `Holography.AreaLaw` | Low | Admissible-state growth tracks bulk volume systematically better than boundary complexity in closure-compatible regimes. | Area-law sweep over synthetic admissible-state datasets (pending). |

## Validation Priority

Recommended order for checking the forward claims:

1. profile rigidity across new realizations,
2. Fejér-over-χ² monotonicity,
3. observable-space collapse,
4. snap-threshold transition law,
5. witness-policy robustness,
6. cone-split persistence.

## Condensed Priority Roadmap

The current TODO list can be collapsed to a small dependency-ordered roadmap:

1. Cross-realization validation package (closure-compatible non-shift snap
   policy + second realization).
2. Contraction ⇒ quadratic theorem.
3. Quadratic ⇒ signature theorem.
4. Concrete constraint-closure theorem.
5. Local recovery / effective-geometry theorem.
6. Signature ⇒ Clifford/spin bridge.

Note: the synthetic one-minus harness now uses a non-shift policy derived from
its witness state type. The Bool inversion harness is present but still reuses
the shift snap witness; next extensions are a Bool inversion-specific witness
and the B₄ harness.

## Current Status

Already closed:

- Stage A orbit-profile signature discrimination,
- Stage B finite 4D cone/signature forcing in the current framework.

Still open:

- Stage C theorem/dynamics closure,
- Stage C observable/prediction closure,
- broader realization-independent and full-physics generalization.

## Next Phase

The next implementation phase is intentionally narrow:

- harden the current minimum-credible closure path so downstream consumers point
  to the real dynamics package rather than generic fallback seams,
- add the first typed forward-test harness,
- use **profile rigidity across new 4D realizations** as the flagship
  benchmark.

Cleanup note:

- one consolidation pass now takes precedence over adding more local wave-regime
  theorem rungs,
- grouped ladder modules are the authoritative internal path for the current
  hotspot,
- old per-rung modules remain available as compatibility surfaces,
- widening resumes only after the canonical summaries import the grouped
  ladder surfaces instead of direct per-rung modules.

Initial benchmark boundary:

- reference realization:
  the current signed-permutation 4D shift realization,
- comparison surface:
  orientation tag, shell-1 profile, shell-2 profile, and final signature,
- benchmark verdicts:
  exact match, signature-only match, mismatch,
- admissible comparison realization:
  one that is intended to preserve the same cone/arrow/isotropy comparison
  boundary and exposes the full orientation/profile/signature surface,
- negative control:
  one that is structurally nearby enough to probe failure modes, but is already
  known not to satisfy the intended comparison boundary.

Current benchmark decision:

- the tail-permutation realization is now treated as a **negative control**,
  not as an admissible alternate realization,
- it still yields a useful first nontrivial rigidity verdict because its shell
  profiles diverge from the signed-permutation reference,
- the next benchmark after that should be a genuinely closure-compatible
  alternate realization.

Current admissible candidate:

- the synthetic one-minus candidate is now the canonical admissible alternate
  realization on the current Stage C path,
- it currently lands as `exactMatch` against the signed-permutation reference,
- Bool inversion remains a secondary admissible comparison and lands as
  `signatureOnlyMatch`.
- the next closure-facing step is to make the rigidity suite part of the
  minimum-credible adapter surface, not just a sibling validation module.
- the synthetic promotion bridge is now closed on the current path:
  shell-1, shell-2, orientation, signature, and a minimal independent-dynamics
  witness are all present, so the candidate now enters the admissible harness.
- the canonical Stage C surface now also exports:
  a dynamics witness companion,
  a concrete canonical constraint-closure status,
  a known-limits status surface,
  a first scoped known-limits recovery witness,
  and a witness-bearing spin/Dirac consumer.
- the canonical Stage C surface now also exports:
  a concrete minimal constraint-closure witness,
  and a stronger known-limits recovery witness carrying actual propagation and
  effective-geometry witnesses on the canonical shift path.
- the canonical Stage C surface now also exports:
  a minimal algebraic-closure theorem for the concrete constraint system,
  a scoped local-recovery theorem for the current local Lorentz +
  propagation slice,
  and a scoped effective-geometry theorem for that same local recovery regime.
- the next runway theorem slices are now explicitly:
  a scoped gauge-contract theorem for the canonical closure baseline,
  and a scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem for the canonical
  spin-facing consumer.
- both of those scoped runway theorems now live on the canonical Stage C path.
- the widening beyond those scoped slices is now landed:
  a carrier-parametric gauge/constraint theorem with the current canonical
  concrete carrier as its first realized instance,
  a second realized carrier instance for that theorem,
  a local causal-effective propagation theorem,
  and a local geometry-transport theorem above the current
  local recovery/effective-geometry slice.
- next widening:
  a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem,
  and a local causal-geometry coherence theorem above the current transport
  slice.
- Those widening slices are now landed.
  Current newest physics-first widening is also landed:
  broaden local recovery beyond the current coherence slice with a stronger
  extended local recovery theorem,
  and broaden the algebra side beyond the current package-parametric bridge
  with a stronger algebraic-coherence theorem.
- That next physics-first widening is now landed:
  add one stronger recovered-local-regime theorem above the current local
  physics-coherence slice,
  and one stronger algebraic-stability theorem above the current
  algebraic-coherence slice.
- That next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  add one stronger recovered-dynamics theorem above the current
  complete-local-regime slice,
  add one stronger algebraic-consistency theorem above the current
  algebraic-bundle/stability slice,
  attach one geometry-facing downstream consumer to the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and keep moonshine hardening secondary through a richer comparison bundle.
- Current next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-geometry theorem above the current
  recovered-wavefront slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-invariance theorem above the current
  transport-invariance slice,
  one wave-geometry-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave family summary on the prototype track.
- Current newest physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-regime theorem above the current
  recovered-wave-geometry slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-persistence theorem above the current
  regime-invariance slice,
  one wave-regime-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave-regime summary on the prototype track.
- Current latest physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-observables theorem above the current
  recovered-wave-regime slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-coherence theorem above the current
  regime-persistence slice,
  one wave-observable-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave-observable summary on the prototype track.

## Next Mathematical Realization Target

After the Bool inversion admissible check, the preferred next alternate
realization is:

- a **Coxeter / Weyl-group realization** of the same 4D shell-orbit data,
  starting in `B₄` / hyperoctahedral language and only later refining to a
  more independent root-system or signed-lattice model.

Why this is the preferred next realization:

- it is mathematically more compelling than another ad hoc dynamics,
- it has a known orbit-stratification story,
- it makes the shell/profile result easier to discuss with geometers,
- it directly tests whether the current profile lock is a signed-orbit
  invariant rather than just a shift artifact.

For the present repo state, the honest next implementation step is:

- add an **independent `B₄` shell-orbit report** built from explicit
  root-shell points and a Weyl-style action,
- keep that report out of the admissible rigidity harness until its shell class
  is shown to be Lorentz-compatible and orientation/signature are justified,
- only then promote it to a full admissible alternate realization.

Current status of that report:

- the independent `B₄` shell data land in the **definite shell class**
  `[8] / [24]`,
- so the current blocker is structural mismatch with the Lorentz shell class,
  not just missing orientation wiring.

## Shell-Family Milestone

The next mathematical milestone is now:

- make **shell-neighborhood class** first-class,
- formalize the bounded one-minus shell family for the dimensions already
  encoded in the repo,
- and only then push for a second Lorentz-family realization.

Current intended bounded family:

- `m = 2 -> [2,2]`
- `m = 3 -> [8,4,2]`
- `m >= 4 -> [4(m-1)(m-2), 2(m-1), 2]`

Roadmap after that:

- bounded family theorem on `m = 2..8`,
- then a parametric `m` shell-1 theorem,
- then a second realization that lands in the same shell neighborhood.

Current closure-burn-down target:

- the canonical Stage C path already uses the concrete shift dynamics package
  and concrete constraint instance,
- the next hardening step is to remove the last trivial constraint shim from
  the empirical full adapter so the recommended closure surfaces all agree on
  the same closure witness,
- and keep the canonical Stage C entrypoint explicit in code so that
  compatibility and prototype surfaces are no longer mistaken for the
  authoritative closure path.

## Orbit-Shell Series Current Status

The repo now already contains a finite orbit-shell generating series layer,
built from:

- orientation tag,
- shell-1 orbit-size multiplicities,
- shell-2 orbit-size multiplicities.

Immediate uses:

- shift series witness from the current theorem-backed profile data,
- standalone `B₄` series comparison,
- prototype wave-graded lift using the finite series as the grade-0 seed.

This series work strengthens comparison and future grading
questions. It does **not** by itself upgrade the repo to a theorem-backed
theta-series or moonshine claim.

The current prototype layer after this finite series is:

- finite graded shell series for shift and `B₄`,
- finite twined traces for signed/Weyl actions on graded shell pieces,
- and a wave-facing graded adapter that remains explicitly prototype-only.

This is now present as a Weyl/theta-like pre-moonshine layer, not as a closure
theorem or a modularity claim.

The next prototype hardening step is broader twiner coverage, a richer
graded/twined comparison summary, and then a stronger wave-grading summary,
while still avoiding any umbral or Monster claim.

## Current Validation Snapshot

The current Stage C validation surface now exposes one explicit rigidity suite
through the minimum-credible closure adapter:

- reference self-check:
  `exactMatch`,
- first admissible alternate realization:
  Bool inversion on the 4D `(3,1)` mask, currently classified as
  `signatureOnlyMatch`,
- negative control:
  tail permutations, classified as `mismatch`.

This means the current closure stack is already stronger at the
**signature-rigidity** level than at the **exact shell-profile-rigidity**
level. The next validation work should preserve this distinction explicitly.

The validation summary now also exposes a falsifiability/deviation boundary
for the shift profile: mirror-signature exclusion plus the competing 4D
candidate profile failures are bundled as a typed boundary report.

## Next Runnable Benchmark

The next runnable benchmark after the rigidity snapshot is:

- **Fejér-over-χ² monotonicity**

For the current repo state, the first honest implementation target is:

- a typed reference harness for the shift realization,
- theorem-backed positive-side witnesses:
  Fejér monotonicity, closest-point behavior, and MDL descent,
- an explicit χ² falsifier-status slot.

This means the first Fejér benchmark report should distinguish:

- what is already theorem-backed on the MDL / closest-point side,
- whether the χ² side is carried by a concrete shift-side boundary witness,
  and whether that witness remains only a boundary proxy or has been upgraded
  to a broader falsifier theorem.

It should not pretend that the χ²-side counterexample is already encoded if
the repo still only documents that part empirically.

Current Fejér benchmark snapshot:

- positive side:
## Observable-Collapse Benchmark

The next benchmark that can be made fully theorem-backed from the current
shift stack is:

- **observable-space collapse**

Reason:

- `RealClosureKitFiber` already carries a distinguished observable endpoint
  `obs0`,
- together with `obsFixed` and `obsUnique`,
- and the shift instance already instantiates that structure concretely.

So this benchmark should be treated as stronger than a mere forward claim for
the current shift realization: it is a typed theorem-backed collapse witness on
the present Stage C path.
  theorem-backed, established, and carried directly by the benchmark harness,
- χ² side:
  now carried by a concrete shift-side boundary witness from the
  snap/`chi2Spike` severity layer,
  with the standalone snap-threshold benchmark exposed separately as its own
  typed report that now includes secondary and tertiary shift-side boundary cases,
  plus synthetic one-minus and Bool inversion non-shift harnesses (Bool
  inversion still reuses the shift snap witness).

For the current `P0/P1/P2` execution order, see
`Docs/PhysicsClosurePriorities.md`.

For the current mathematical framing of the orbit-shell result, see
`Docs/OrbitShellProfilesAndLorentzSignature.md`.
Cleanup turn:
- the organizational cleanup pass is now landed,
- canonical Stage C remains authoritative,
- old long module names still remain for compatibility,
- shorter hierarchy modules and ladder maps are now in place for the current
  wave-regime hotspot.
Current note:
- this turn is a cleanup/consolidation turn
- no new local theorem rungs are being added
- the local canonical program is treated as complete enough to freeze while the repo is reorganized
