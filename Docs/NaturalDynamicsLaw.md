# Natural Physical Dynamics Law (Doc lane)

This note isolates the *minimum theorem/program shape* required to claim a natural, non-engineered dynamics law in the Dashi stack. It draws from the closure pipeline, the Lorentz-seeking summaries, and the RG dynamics notes to list the state space, candidate evolution laws, admissibility conditions, and the outstanding engineered/post-selected points.

**State space**

- `State` = `ShiftState` for `(m=1,k=3)` as used in `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda` and the RG instance: an ultrametric vector of four signed integers supporting MDL, projection, and cone evaluation.
- `Observable` space = Drop of `ShiftConeCompatible` + Hecke signature/eigen/motif summary saved in `Docs/PhotonBridge.md` and the RG notes; these engineered outputs are the objects under observation.
- `Coarse shell` = `shiftCoarse` from `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftRGObservableInstance.agda`, which projects via `LFS.coarseProj` into an invariant coarse subspace.

**Evolution law candidates**

1. `ShiftStep` (MDL Lyapunov step) from `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda` and `[Docs/CharmPhotoproduction.md](./CharmPhotoproduction.md)`: contraction + MDL descent utilities interpreted as the canonical evolution `T(x)`.
2. `ShiftCoarse` / `ShiftCoarseAlt` from the RG notes: projection-driven flows defined via `LFS.embedCoarse ◦ LFS.coarseProj` and the phase-shifted composite with `step`. These are not emergent laws but engineered coarse-graining maps.
3. Candidate `Rᵣ`, `Pᵣ`, `Tᵣ` flows in `DASHI/Physics/TailCollapseProof.agda` and `Docs/SaturationLayer.md`: physical RG-style renormalizers that collapse tail-data but are not yet wired to the canonical dynamics.

**Admissibility conditions**

- `ShiftRGAdmissible` bundles `ShiftInBasin` with `ShiftConeCompatible` and the execution-admissibility witness from `ShiftLorentzEmergenceInstance.agda`: MDL descent, cone invariance on projected delta, and basin stability.
- RG observables require `admissible⇒basin` and `admissible` closures defined in `Docs/CMSCapstone.md` and `DASHI/Physics/Closure/RGObservableInvariance.agda`, so true dynamics are only those satisfying both the geometric cone law and the coarse basin law.

**Why current dynamics look engineered/post-selected**

1. `shiftCoarse` is a prescriptive projection rather than a derived law; it uses `LFS.coarseProj`/`embedCoarse` without a dynamical derivation, so the flow is engineered in the code.
2. `ShiftCoarseAlt` and the phase-offset universality theorems in `Docs/CMSCapstone.md` compare ad-hoc schedules, not distinct emergent flows.
3. Basin and cone compatibility are enforced via fixed witnesses (e.g., canonical shell points, `ShiftInBasin` = `pos ∷ []`), so the dynamics are post-selected to keep the law satisfied.
4. The saturation/numerical lane (`Docs/SaturationLayer.md`) writes the response as a GBW-like prototype; the physics content still lives in the external model layer and is not derived from the internal dynamics.

**Repo-accurate correction**

The main gap is not that the repo lacks an execution contract from zero.
[`ExecutionContract.agda`](../DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContract.agda)
already exists and the shift lane already instantiates it. The stronger
problem is that several of the current shift-side witnesses are still too weak
or too local:

- arrow/eigen summaries are still trivialized on the shift side,
- basin nontriviality still concentrates on the canonical `(1,3)` carrier,
- and the best dynamics/invariant couplings are still local rather than
  realization-independent.

**Bridge toward natural dynamics law**

To answer the request, we require: a state space defined by the `ShiftState` vector and cone witness, an evolution candidate that emerges from contraction + projection (not a hand-wired coarse map), admissibility tied to geometry/MDL rather than fixed witnesses, and a demonstration that the engineered coarse maps can be replaced by naturally emergent flows (e.g., `Tᵣ` or `Rᵣ` flows). Without that derivation, the law remains engineered/post-selected.

This document is disjoint from shared README/TODO files and can serve as the working note for the natural dynamics law lane.
