# Physics Closure Priorities

## Cleanup Freeze

This turn is a consolidation turn.

- No new wave-regime theorem rungs should be added.
- Grouped ladder modules are now the authoritative internal API.
- Per-rung files remain for compatibility only.
- The next widening cycle resumes only after the canonical summaries and
  bundles depend on grouped ladder surfaces.

## P0 — Validation and Closure Hardening

This is the current highest-priority phase.

Goals:

- keep the minimum-credible closure path authoritative,
- run the first substantive profile-rigidity benchmark,
- stop treating negative controls as if they were candidate alternate
  realizations.

Concrete tasks:

- define the admissible comparison realization interface,
- keep the tail-permutation case as a negative control,
- add one genuinely closure-compatible second realization,
- surface the first admissible result explicitly:
  the synthetic one-minus candidate now lands as `exactMatch`,
  while Bool inversion remains a secondary admissible
  `signatureOnlyMatch`,
- run the profile-rigidity harness and classify the outcome,
- keep downstream closure consumers attached to the real dynamics package.

Exit criteria:

- one non-reference realization is classified by the harness,
- the result is recorded as exact match, signature-only match, or mismatch,
- the closure path still compiles through the minimum-credible adapter.

Current snapshot:

- reference signed-permutation self-check: `exactMatch`
- synthetic one-minus admissible candidate: `exactMatch`
- Bool inversion secondary admissible candidate: `signatureOnlyMatch`
- tail-permutation negative control: `mismatch`

Immediate next step after this snapshot:

- surface the same three outcomes through a repo-facing closure summary
  entrypoint so they are easy to cite without walking the validation modules
  directly.
- start the Fejér-over-χ² benchmark as a typed reference harness with:
  theorem-backed Fejér / closest-point / MDL witnesses,
  and an explicit χ² falsifier-status field.
- make the next mathematically serious alternate realization a Coxeter/Weyl
  one:
  first an independent `B₄` shell/profile report,
  then orientation/signature refinement,
  then harness promotion.
- next algebraic handle:
  use the already-landed finite orbit-shell generating-series layer for the
  theorem-backed shift profile, then compare `B₄` at the series level before
  attempting any admissible promotion.
- current symmetry-side prototype after that:
  finite graded shell series and twined fixed-point traces are now present for
  the shift signed action and the `B₄` Weyl action, while the wave lift
  remains a prototype grading adapter only.
- next symmetry-side hardening step:
  broaden twiner coverage and promote the current graded/twined report into a
  richer comparison summary, while keeping the whole track explicitly
  pre-moonshine and non-modular.
- current theorem object:
  use the bounded one-minus shell family plus the landed parametric `m`
  shell-1 theorem as the baseline shell-neighborhood story, then move to
  shell-2 / orientation follow-through or a second Lorentz-family
  realization.
- immediate theorem/benchmark sub-goals:
  finish the arithmetic lemma layer for the full parametric shell-1 theorem,
  formalize the χ²-boundary witness on the shift reference,
  and add a typed snap-threshold benchmark from the concrete severity policy.
- current closure hardening object:
  keep the canonical Stage C path on concrete constraint closure and real shift
  dynamics, and remove the remaining trivial closure shim from the empirical
  full adapter, while exposing an explicit canonical Stage C entrypoint/status
  surface in code so repo-facing consumers stop drifting back to compatibility
  modules.
- next dynamics-hardening object:
  make the canonical shift dynamics package expose a structured status surface
  for propagation, causal admissibility, monotone quantity, and effective
  geometry.
- immediate runway-hardening object:
  add a semantics-bearing dynamics witness companion plus canonical
  constraint-closure and known-limits status surfaces so downstream closure
  consumers have a stronger baseline than status tags alone.
- immediate downstream / limits object:
  keep the witness-bearing canonical spin/Dirac consumer and the first scoped
  known-limits recovery witness on the authoritative Stage C path, then move
  the next runway target to stronger local propagation / local-Lorentz
  follow-through rather than broad GR/QFT claims.
- immediate algebraic / limits hardening object:
  add a concrete minimal constraint-closure witness and a stronger known-limits
  recovery witness carrying actual propagation/effective-geometry data, then
  use those as the baseline for the next scoped recovery theorem.
- immediate theorem object after that:
  keep the canonical path on a minimal algebraic-closure theorem and a scoped
  local-recovery theorem, plus a scoped effective-geometry theorem for the
  same regime, then only afterward widen the runway toward richer
  gauge/known-limits claims.
- next scoped runway order:
  gauge-contract theorem first,
  then spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem,
  then only afterward widen toward broader gauge or known-limits claims.
- current state:
  both scoped runway theorems now sit on the canonical Stage C path; the next
  widening step is beyond these scoped slices.
- current widened target:
  the carrier-parametric gauge/constraint theorem is now landed with a second
  realized carrier instance,
  and the local causal-effective propagation theorem is now landed with a
  further local geometry-transport theorem.
- next widening step:
  add a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem on the algebra
  side,
  and add a local causal-geometry coherence theorem beyond the current local
  geometry-transport slice on the known-limits side.
- Those are now landed.
  Current newest physics-first widening is also landed:
  a stronger extended local recovery theorem beyond the current coherence
  slice,
  plus a stronger algebraic-coherence theorem on top of the current package
  layer.
- That next physics-first widening is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-local-regime theorem above the current local
  physics-coherence slice,
  and one stronger algebraic-stability theorem above the current
  algebraic-coherence slice.
- That next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-dynamics theorem above the current complete-local
  regime slice,
  one stronger algebraic-consistency theorem above the current
  algebraic-bundle/stability slice,
  one geometry-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical ladder,
  and one richer moonshine comparison bundle on the prototype track.
- Current next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-geometry theorem above the current
  recovered-wavefront slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-invariance theorem above the current
  transport-invariance slice,
  one wave-geometry-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave family summary on the prototype track.
- Current newest physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-regime theorem above the current
  recovered-wave-geometry slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-persistence theorem above the current
  regime-invariance slice,
  one wave-regime-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave-regime summary on the prototype track.
- Current latest physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-observables theorem above the current
  recovered-wave-regime slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-coherence theorem above the current
  regime-persistence slice,
  one wave-observable-facing downstream consumer on the widened canonical
  ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave-observable summary on the prototype track.

## P1 — Runnable Forward Benchmarks

Once P0 is complete, the next priority is turning the other forward claims into
typed runnable checks.

Ordered targets:

1. Fejér-over-χ² monotonicity
2. observable-space collapse
3. snap-threshold transition law

Each benchmark should expose:

- a typed report,
- a falsifier,
- a reference harness or dataset,
- an explicit distinction between proved outputs and measured outcomes.

Immediate first implementation:

- the shift realization acts as the reference harness,
- the positive side is theorem-backed already and should be carried directly by
  the benchmark report,
- the χ² side is allowed to progress through intermediate states:
  pending,
  interface-wired,
  formalized.
- observable-space collapse is the next benchmark that can be made fully
  theorem-backed from existing shift witnesses, because the real closure kit
  already carries `obsFixed` and `obsUnique`.
- the next benchmark hardening step is:
  use the landed concrete χ²-boundary witness and standalone snap-threshold
  report as the new baseline, then decide whether to promote the χ² side into
  a broader falsifier theorem or explicit counterexample library.
- immediate next validation refinement:
  grow the single shift χ²-boundary witness into an explicit small witness
  library so the Fejér benchmark has a real counterexample surface rather
  than one privileged state.
- immediate next realization-search step:
  add an independent shell-side one-minus-family candidate in the Lorentz
  neighborhood, but keep it outside the admissible harness until shell-2,
  orientation, and signature are justified independently.
- current realization-search refinement:
  the synthetic one-minus candidate is now profile-aware on shell-1 and
  shell-2, and the dynamics-side search artifact has been tightened into a
  minimal admissible-dynamics witness for the current synthetic path.
- immediate promotion-side task:
  add a typed synthetic-promotion bridge that records whether orientation and
  signature are independently justified, then only promote to the admissible
  harness if both become available.
- current promotion-side status:
  orientation/signature are bridged on the synthetic path, a minimal
  independent-dynamics witness is present, and the candidate now enters the
  admissible rigidity harness.

Current second-realization preference:

- the synthetic one-minus candidate is now the canonical admissible alternate
  realization,
- Bool inversion remains a useful secondary admissible comparison,
- the next mathematically preferred one is Coxeter/Weyl-based rather than
  another bespoke contraction flow.
- that Coxeter/Weyl path should enter in two steps:
  independent shell/profile report first, admissible harness later.
- but it is no longer the immediate next theorem milestone.
  First priority is:
  shell-neighborhood class -> parametric one-minus family theorem ->
  second Lorentz-family realization.

## P2 — Stronger Dynamics and Physics Closure

Only after P0 and P1 should the repo push further into broader physics-closure
claims.

Priority tasks:

- strengthen the dynamics package with clearer propagation and conservation
  statements,
- harden spin/Dirac, gauge, and constraint consumers against the minimum
  closure boundary,
- start scoped known-limits recovery work,
- expand prediction work beyond internal closure observables.

Immediate precondition:

- finish the current closure burn-down so the canonical Stage C path is free of
  trivial closure shims, while legacy assumption-backed modules remain clearly
  marked as compatibility surfaces.

This remains well short of any “solved physics” claim.

## P1 Theorem-Seam Requirement

For the shell-action theorem seam, the implementation target is:

- the theorem-critical intrinsic shell/orbit path must no longer mention
  finite carrier points, finite action lists, shell predicates, or finite
  realization records,
- those finite realization artifacts may remain on the shift-instance discharge
  side as validation support only.
Cleanup status:
- short-path ladder modules and export-surface cleanup are now landed for the
  current wave-regime hotspot, so the canonical Stage C path is readable
  enough to resume the widening loop.
- Active widening mode:
  continue the `1/2/3/4` loop on the cleaned structure, keeping physics first
  and the pre-moonshine track strictly parallel and prototype-only.
