# Repo Guide

Declared surface level: `packaging`.

This guide is for a new serious reader who needs the repo's structure, claim
boundaries, and practical entrypoints without reading every status surface.

## What This Repository Is

This repo is an Agda-first formalization workspace centered on DASHI geometry,
closure, and theorem-packaging layers, with supporting analysis, ontology, and
script surfaces. It contains both authoritative theorem modules and many
supporting documents that record current status, planning, experiments, or
empirical packaging.

Use claim-level language carefully:

- `canonical` means authoritative for current repo claims.
- `strong` means a strengthened theorem surface with explicit seam witnesses.
- `validation` means cross-check or audit surface, not the canonical proof path.
- `experimental` or `theorem-thin` means packaging, scaffold, or bounded
  consumer surface, not a full derivation claim.

## Top-Level Structure

- `DASHI/`: main Agda codebase. This is the primary source of formal claims.
- `Kernel/` and `Verification/`: smaller foundational and proof-support
  surfaces that are suitable for routine validation.
- `Ontology/`: domain-specific formal lanes, especially Hecke and DNA.
- `Docs/`: canonical prose maps, bridge notes, validation policy, and diagrams.
- `scripts/`: validation helpers, routing tools, diagram rendering, and data
  preparation utilities.
- `artifacts/` and `data/`: generated or materialized support surfaces. These
  are usually evidence or inputs, not the theorem source of truth.
- `README.md`: repo-facing entry surface and current high-level status summary.
- `architecture.md`: canonical architecture and diagram entrypoint map.

## Canonical Vs Status-Only Surfaces

Read these as authoritative or near-authoritative:

- `README.md` for current repo-facing orientation and diagram pointers.
- `architecture.md` for the canonical theorem route and diagram entrypoints.
- `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.md` for the single proof spine to cite in docs and
  imports.
- `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` for what to compile in normal work loops.
- specific owner modules in `DASHI/` for the actual formal claim surface.

Read these as status, planning, or execution control surfaces rather than
authoritative theorem definitions:

- `status.md` and `status.json`
- `spec.md`
- `plan.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `COMPACTIFIED_CONTEXT.md`
- most thread-derived or packaging notes in `Docs/` unless they explicitly map
  back to canonical modules

Rule of thumb: if a prose document and an Agda owner module disagree, the owner
module wins. If two prose surfaces disagree, prefer `architecture.md`, then
`README.md`, then focused docs such as `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.md`.

## Theorem Spine Entrypoints

The repo's authoritative closure route is the canonical spine recorded in
`architecture.md` and restated in `spec.md`:

1. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefect`
2. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`
3. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefectToParallelogram`
4. `DASHI.Geometry.QuadraticForm`
5. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`
6. `DASHI.Geometry.CausalForcesLorentz31`
7. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`
8. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
9. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`

For a reader, the practical theorem-spine entry docs are:

- `architecture.md`
- `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.md`
- `Docs/ClosureContractStatus.md`

Important boundary:

- this spine is the required route for current closure claims
- alternate derivation routes may exist in the tree, but they should be read as
  `alternative`, `validation`, or `experimental` unless explicitly promoted

## Build And Validation Surfaces

For routine work, do not start with the largest aggregates.

Preferred focused validation policy:

- use the targets listed in `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`
- compile one or two canonical bridge modules directly during local edits
- use `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureSummary.agda` for a broader but still
  manageable canonical summary

Known heavy or bounded-only surfaces:

- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`
- `DASHI/Everything.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageC.agda` as a checkpoint, not a default
  inner-loop target

Useful script entrypoints:

- `scripts/run_agda_easy_to_hard.py`
- `scripts/route_agda_by_layer.py`
- `scripts/run_closure_hygiene.py`
- `scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh`

## Docs, Diagrams, And Modules

The docs are best read as maps to code, not replacements for code.

Current canonical diagram surfaces:

- `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.puml`
- `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.svg`
- `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml`
- `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`

Diagram policy:

- `.puml` is the diffable source of truth
- `.svg` is the rendered preview
- regenerate previews with `./scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh`
- use `architecture.md` as the canonical textual entrypoint for diagrams

Module-to-doc relation:

- `architecture.md` and `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.md` map the main closure path
- `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md` maps code modules to validation practice
- focused docs in `Docs/` usually explain one lane, gap, or consumer layer and
  should be read alongside the cited Agda modules

## Recommended Reading Order For Engineers

1. `README.md`
2. `architecture.md`
3. `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.md`
4. `Docs/AgdaValidationTargets.md`
5. the canonical spine modules themselves, in order
6. `Docs/ClosureContractStatus.md` for the current seam boundary
7. only then read lane-specific docs in `Docs/` that match the subsystem you
   are touching

If you are editing code rather than auditing it:

1. identify whether your target is `canonical`, `validation`, or
   `experimental`
2. validate the narrowest owner module first
3. avoid treating `Everything.agda` or large status docs as the primary source
   of truth

## Formal Owner Modules

These are the modules a reader should treat as owner surfaces for the current
closure path:

- `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefect.agda`
- `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`
- `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.agda`
- `DASHI/Geometry/QuadraticForm.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`
- `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda`

## Consumer Modules

These are important consumers, bundles, summaries, or downstream packaging
surfaces, but they should not be confused with the entire proof spine:

- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureFullInstance.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosureShiftInstance.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/KnownLimitsGRBridgeTheorem.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda`
- `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda`

## Not This / Out Of Scope

- Do not read `status.md`, `TODO.md`, or thread-derived notes as if they were
  the theorem source of truth.
- Do not treat `DASHI/Everything.agda` as the normal starting point for local
  work; it is authoritative but too aggregate for routine use.
- Do not interpret theorem-thin, empirical, or packaging lanes as closure proofs
  unless the owner module explicitly promotes that claim.
- Do not infer that every subdirectory under `DASHI/`, `Ontology/`, or `Monster/`
  participates in the canonical closure path.
