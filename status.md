# Status

- Phase: canonical bridge hardening complete; physics-closure execution checklist activated
- Canonical spine:
  `ProjectionDefect → ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram
  → ProjectionDefectToParallelogram → QuadraticForm
  → ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong
  → CausalForcesLorentz31
  → ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem
  → QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem
  → CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem
  → ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem`
- Milestones:
  - canonical causal-classification choke point module: done
  - normalized quadratic seam threaded from strengthened contraction: done
  - Lemma A (Euclidean/degenerate elimination) and Lemma B
    (isotropy+arrow+finite-speed forcing) split: done
  - intrinsic shift signature theorem rewired to causal theorem-primary source: done
  - orbit profile retained as secondary witness/cross-check: done
  - canonical bridge interface stability (`S31OP.signature31-*`): done
  - canonical `WaveLift⇒Even` factorization bridge (`CliffordGrading`, `EvenSubalgebra`, witness form through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`): done
  - canonical Stage C bridge threading through
    `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` and
    `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`: done
- Tests:
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/LocalProgramBundle.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/Canonical/Ladder.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureSummary.agda`: pass
  - `timeout 120s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda`: timeout `124` with no type
    errors emitted
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Geometry/Signature31FromIntrinsicShellForcing.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Signature31IntrinsicShiftInstance.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Signature31FromShiftOrbitProfile.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda`: pass
  - `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem.agda`: pass
- Constraints:
  - Lemma A/B are explicit theorem seams but still carry minimal forcing payload;
    stronger constructive eliminators/classification terms remain next.
  - keep routine skip policy for direct
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` checks while
    runtime remains high.
- Active execution source:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`
- Checklist progress:
  - Phase 1 hardening pass started and landed:
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`,
    `ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.
  - Profile/signature front-door hardening landed:
    `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfile`,
    `ConeArrowIsotropyForcesProfileShiftInstance`,
    `OrbitProfileExternal` canonical profile pipeline.
  - Decimation-to-Clifford specialization landed:
    `DecimationToClifford` now exposes explicit relation/factorization
    theorem interfaces instead of abstract placeholders.
  - `PhysicsClosureFull` derivation pass in progress:
    full-closure adapters now consume canonical theorem-chain outputs for
    quadratic/signature (`ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem`,
    `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`).
  - Constraint-closure witness layer now uses canonical-path transport theorem
    (`ConstraintClosureFromCanonicalPathTheorem`), and instance-layer wiring
    now also uses `canonicalPathInducedConstraintClosure` after introducing a
    lightweight path witness to break prior import cycles.
  - Canonical export surfaces now expose path-derived closure artifacts:
    `canonicalConstraintPathWitness` and
    `canonicalConstraintClosureFromPathTheorem` in `CanonicalStageC`,
    threaded through theorem and summary bundles.
  - `PhysicsClosureFull` now has a canonical builder
    (`canonicalPhysicsClosureFullFromExternal`) that derives
    contraction/quadratic/signature/constraint fields from canonical theorem
    chain outputs, with only external inputs passed by instances.
  - Added canonical endpoint bridge package
    (`PhysicsClosureFullCanonicalBridgePackage`) and exported it through
    `CanonicalStageC` theorem + summary bundles.
  - `AxiomSet` now carries explicit law-status registry
    (`canonical-theorem` / `concrete-instance` / `remaining-assumption`).
  - Heavy regression check:
    `agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageC.agda`: pass.
  - Runtime guardrail reaffirmed:
    `timeout 20s agda -i . DASHI/Everything.agda` exits `124` in
    `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`.
  - Bounded canonical-stage recheck:
    `timeout 90s agda -i . DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalStageC.agda`
    exits `124` (no type errors emitted before timeout).
- Next action:
  run a focused audit on remaining non-canonical assumption surfaces
  (`PhysicsClosureInstanceAssumed.metricEmergence` and legacy adapters) and
  either derive or isolate them off the canonical route.
