<objective>
Turn the current “generic contractive operator system” into a non-toy, theorem-critical real-operator instance by identifying and tightening the real operator definitions `Cᵣ`, `Pᵣ`, `Rᵣ`.

Purpose: The missing substance is real operators satisfying the closure axioms; this plan makes that gap explicit and drives it to the first credible non-toy instance.
Output: A stub inventory + a concrete decision on what is considered “real operator” vs “prototype identity” + first upgraded operator(s) with proofs needed by the stack.

  <files>.planning/07-03-REAL-OPERATORS-INVENTORY.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/07-03-REAL-OPERATORS-INVENTORY.md` with:
- Exact current definitions of `Cᵣ`, `Pᵣ`, `Rᵣ` (quote the key lines / describe behavior).
- Which ones are identity/prototype and why that is currently “not yet physical”.
- What properties are already proved (e.g. nonexpansive) and which are missing for “credible”.

What to avoid and why:
- Do NOT change operator semantics in this task; this is an audit artifact that grounds later changes.
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists and explicitly mentions `Cᵣ`, `Pᵣ`, and `Rᵣ` and references the exact module paths.
  </verify>
  <done>
Operator gap is documented in a way that makes the next upgrade steps unambiguous.

  <context>
Right now `Cᵣ` and `Rᵣ` are identity in `DASHI/Physics/RealOperators.agda` and `Pᵣ` is a small projection-like head-zeroing operation. To make the physics bridge credible, we need to decide what minimal nontrivial semantics is acceptable for the first upgraded instance, without destabilizing compilation.

  <action>
Based on the decision, implement the smallest change that moves at least one operator away from identity while:
- preserving nonexpansive proofs or updating them to match,
- keeping `RealOperatorStack` compiling,
- and keeping the change localized to the operator layer.

What to avoid and why:
- Do NOT touch signature forcing / Stage C ladder in this plan; keep blast radius small.
- Do NOT move modules; only edit in-place.
  </action>
  <verify>
`agda -i . -i /usr/share/agda/lib/stdlib DASHI/Physics/RealOperatorStack.agda` succeeds.
  </verify>
  <done>
At least one of `Cᵣ` or `Rᵣ` is non-identity with corresponding proof obligations still satisfied.

<success_criteria>

- The “missing real operators” gap is documented concretely
- A clear decision is made about minimal acceptable non-toy semantics
- The code reflects that decision with a compile-checked operator upgrade

- Accomplishments
- Decision made and rationale
- Files modified
- Compile status
