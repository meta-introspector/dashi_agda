# Compactified Context

- Physics bridge stubs were added under `DASHI/Physics/` to mirror the remaining “unproven” list with minimal records/postulates.
- A new `AdmissibleQuadratic` interface now bundles contraction, isotropy, involution, and finite-speed invariances; uniqueness is the intended bottleneck.
- Shared symmetry definitions (`Isotropy`, `PreservesQuadratic`) live in `DASHI/Physics/Core.agda`.
- Current milestone: remove remaining postulates in `DASHI/Physics/*` by providing concrete witnesses and wiring to existing bridge modules.
- Added concrete geometry helpers for isotropy and finite-speed with trivial instances for wiring: `DASHI/Geometry/Isotropy.agda`, `DASHI/Geometry/FiniteSpeed.agda`.
- Extended `Contraction.agda` with `StrictContraction` (contractive + unique fixed point).
- Repo fully typechecks against stdlib; ternary carrier + agreement ultrametric are concrete and postulate-free.
- Real operator stack now uses tail-zeroing projection `Pᵣ` and fine-agreement ultrametric; nontrivial isotropy (C₂ sign-flip) and finite-speed (ball locality) are wired.
- Strict contraction and fixed-point claims are now framed via **fiber/quotient contraction**: added `FiberContraction` and `RealClosureKitFiber`, and `TernaryRealInstance` provides observable fixed/unique on tail digit.
- Remaining global StrictContraction path is still available but not used for the real ternary instance; physics closure now uses the fiber kit.
- Next milestone focuses on canonicalization on the coarse core and a quadratic invariant; signature/orthogonality are introduced as named assumption targets.
2026-02-23:
- Removed nonexpCᵣ and nonexpR postulates. Added constructive proofs in:
  - `DASHI/Metric/FineAgreementUltrametric.agda`
  - `DASHI/Physics/CanonicalizationMinimal.agda`
  - `DASHI/Physics/RealOperatorStackShift.agda`
- Added supporting lemmas: agreement-depth monotonicity under map/append/shiftTail, dNatFine-++ and shiftTail ≤.
- `DASHI_Tests.agda` typechecks (warnings only).
Open: clean up pattern-shadow warnings in FineAgreementUltrametric if desired.
Added:
- `DASHI/Physics/QuadraticPolarization.agda` (ℤ embedding + B₂ℤ polarization seam).
- `DASHI/Physics/DimensionBoundAssumptions.agda` (orbit-profile dimension bound seam).
- `DASHI/Physics/SignatureAssumptions.agda` no longer exports Force-1+3.
2026-02-23:

  - Added `DASHI/Physics/MaskedQuadraticRenormalization.agda` with constructive Qσ‑R (masked quadratic under Rᵣ).
  - Added `DASHI/Physics/MaskedConeStructure.agda` (Timelike/Spacelike/Null, cone monotonicity seam, unique time direction seam).
  - Added `DASHI/Physics/OrbitFingerprintAssumptions.agda` (orbit fingerprint predicate, minimality/saturation seams).
  - `DASHI/Physics/ClosureOnAssumption.agda` now re-exports these modules.
- Agda checks pass for new modules; only remaining warnings are pattern-shadow in FineAgreementUltrametric.
2026-02-23:
- Added `DASHI/Physics/RealConeStructureInstance.agda` with concrete cone monotonicity proof for the trivial causal structure and a no-two-timelike lemma for the one-minus mask.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/OrbitFingerprintInstance.agda` to map `ShellOrbitProfile` to a signature-indexed `OrbitFingerprint`.
- Cleaned all pattern-shadow warnings in `DASHI/Metric/FineAgreementUltrametric.agda` (Nat.zero patterns); no warnings on recheck.
2026-02-23:
- Added `DASHI/Physics/OrbitShellPredicate.agda` and `DASHI/Physics/RealCausalStructureInstance.agda`.
- `TernaryRealInstanceShift` now exposes `shell1` and `orbitFingerprint`.
- Finite-speed instance in shift stack remains trivial (pending nonexpPᵣ for shift Pᵣ).
2026-02-23:
- Added projTail nonexpansive lemmas in `DASHI/Metric/FineAgreementUltrametric.agda`.
- Added `nonexpP` in `DASHI/Physics/RealOperatorStackShift.agda`.
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/RealFiniteSpeedInstanceShift.agda` and wired `TernaryRealInstanceShift.fs` to it.
2026-02-23:
- `TernaryRealInstanceShift` now includes a locality-based causal structure and cone monotonicity lemma.
2026-02-23:
- Canonicalization kept as neg→pos/zer; isotropy relaxed instead.
- Added `RealIsotropyInstanceShiftTailInv` (Bool tail‑sign‑flip isotropy) and `dNatFine-++-map≤-tail` for metric preservation.
- Replaced `orbitProfile` postulate with concrete `OrbitProfileExternal.orbitProfile-m6`.
- Added `RealCausalStructureNontrivial` (delta = x, order = Qσ≥0) and wired into `TernaryRealInstanceShift`.
- `TernaryRealInstanceShift` typechecks with the new isotropy/orbit profile/causal structure.
2026-02-23:
- Added `MaskedOrthogonalSplitConstructive` with constructive core⊥tail under B2σ and dotσ, no postulates; module typechecks.
2026-02-24 (planned next):
- Postulate sweep: enumerate remaining `postulate`s and classify closure-critical vs. scaffolding; remove or isolate closure-critical ones.
- Replace external orbit profile with a concrete generator (Shell1 enumeration) and wire into `TernaryRealInstanceShift`.
- Push causal structure beyond `delta = zeroVec` (define delta via ultrametric distance or tail difference) and prove cone monotonicity using existing nonexpansive lemmas.
2026-02-24 update:
- Added `DASHI/Physics/ShellOrbitProfileGenerator.agda` (builds `ShellOrbitProfile` from sorted orbit sizes).
- Updated `DASHI/Physics/OrbitProfileExternal.agda` to use generator and explicit `orbitSizes` list.
- Added external profiles for m=2..8 (one-minus signature family) based on the scan output.
- Added `.planning/POSTULATE_SWEEP.md` with a closure-critical postulate inventory (Physics-only; shift closure spine is postulate-free).
- Captured full scan table in `.planning/ORBIT_PROFILE_DATA.md`.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/OrbitProfileComputed.agda` (internal shell orbit profile computation for Bool action) and wired `TernaryRealInstanceShift` to use it.
2026-02-24 plan (next):
- Add tail-permutation isotropy modules to mirror the Python scan group (new action + orbit profile).
- Keep Bool isotropy wired until tail-perm commutation/metric-preservation proofs are constructed.
2026-02-24 update:
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/ShiftIsotropyTailPerm.agda`, `DASHI/Physics/OrbitProfileComputedTailPerm.agda`, and `DASHI/Geometry/RealIsotropyInstanceShiftTailPerm.agda`.
- Tail-perm orbit profile uses a postulated permutation list; tail-perm isotropy instance not wired yet to keep closure spine postulate-free.
2026-02-24 update (closure surface skeletons):
- Added quadratic emergence, cone/signature, constraint closure, MDL, defect→curvature, instances, and closure harness modules (see `DASHI/Geometry/*`, `DASHI/Physics/Constraints/*`, `DASHI/MDL/*`, `DASHI/Instances/*`, `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosure.agda`).
2026-02-24 update:
- Hardcoded `allPerms` for k=4 in `DASHI/Physics/OrbitProfileComputedTailPerm.agda` to remove the remaining postulate in that module.
2026-02-24 note:
- Tail-permutation isotropy is incompatible with `Rᵣ/Pᵣ` commutation (shiftTail/projTail). Need to keep Bool isotropy for the closure spine or change operators/restrict group.
2026-02-24 update (new skeletons):
- Added `ProjectionDefect`, `QuadraticForm`, `QuadraticFormEmergence`, `ConeTimeIsotropy`, `Signature31FromConeArrowIsotropy`, and `Physics/Universality` modules as closure-surface stubs.

2026-02-24 plan (go on 1/2/3 continued):
- Wire `PhysicsClosureFull` to concrete instances (starting with Bool closure stack).

- Added `MDLDescentShiftInstance.agda` and re-exported via `ShiftEnergyMDLInstances`.
2026-02-24 update:
- Added `DASHI/Energy/FejerToClosestPoint.agda` (single-seam bridge from Fejér to closest-point).

2026-02-25 update:
- Added empirical interpretation note: Fejér/closest-point descent (MDL proxy) is the intended contraction geometry; χ² space is not globally contractive. Comments added to `DASHI/MDL/MDLDescentTradeoff.agda` and `DASHI/Energy/ClosestPoint.agda`.
2026-02-25 update:
- Proved `fejer⇒closestShift` for the shift instance from ultrametric inequality + Fejér (no postulate).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/MDLFejerAxiomsShift.agda` (formal MDL Fejér/monotone descent witness).

2026-02-25 update:
- Wired `mdlFejer` into `PhysicsClosureFull` and `PhysicsClosureFullInstance`.
- Added new geometry packs per spec: `ClosestPoint`, `Parallelogram`, `Polarization`, `InnerProductFromParallelogram`, `QuadraticFromNorm`, `MaskedQuadratic`, `MQContractive`.
