# Compactified Context

- 2026-03-08:
  - clarified the closure-facing observable package boundary:
    proved outputs and excluded alternatives remain typed;
    genuinely forward predictions are documented separately until they have a
    real formal interface.
  - added a forward-prediction shortlist to `Docs/MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure.md`
    with confidence levels and falsifiers:
    profile rigidity, Fejér-over-χ² monotonicity, observable-space collapse,
    snap-threshold transition laws, witness-policy robustness, cone-split
    persistence, plus more speculative defect-curvature and area-law claims.
  - set the next Stage C implementation phase to:
    closure hardening plus a profile-rigidity validation harness.
  - added typed validation modules under
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Validation/`:
    a realization-observation interface, benchmark verdict/report types,
    a signed-permutation reference report, and a tail-permutation alternate
    slot.
  - upgraded the tail-permutation slot into a real comparison case with
    computed shell-1 and shell-2 profiles for the `(3,1)` mask.
  - tail permutations are now treated as a negative control for profile
    rigidity, not as an admissible comparison realization.
  - added `Docs/PhysicsClosurePriorities.md` with the current `P0/P1/P2`
    order:
    P0 validation and closure hardening,
    P1 runnable forward benchmarks,
    P2 stronger dynamics and broader closure.
  - formalized an `AdmissibleComparisonRealization` interface in the profile
    rigidity harness so future alternate realizations must expose the full
    orientation/profile/signature surface.
  - implemented the first admissible alternate realization:
    the 4D Bool inversion candidate on the `(3,1)` mask.
  - `signatureOnlyMatch` now means:
    same signature, different shell-profile class.
  - added an aggregate rigidity-suite report that groups:
    self exact match,
    Bool inversion admissible result,
    and tail-permutation negative control.
  - added a closure-facing validation adapter on top of
    `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure`, so the Stage C entrypoint can expose
    current rigidity verdicts directly.
  - started the Fejér-over-χ² benchmark as a typed shift reference harness.
  - upgraded the χ² side from a flat `pending` status to an intermediate
    `interfaceWired` state, because the snap stack already carries a
    `chi2Spike` boundary even though a standalone χ² falsifier theorem is not
    yet formalized.
  - tightened the Fejér benchmark internals so the positive side now carries
    the actual theorem witnesses directly rather than placeholder booleans.
  - documented the next mathematically serious alternate realization as a
    Coxeter / Weyl-group one rather than another ad hoc dynamics.
  - replaced the vocabulary-only `B₄` scaffold with an independent shell-orbit
    computation built from explicit root-shell points and a Weyl-style action:
    `RootSystemB4Carrier`, `RootSystemB4WeylAction`,
    `OrbitProfileComputedRootSystemB4`.
  - added a standalone `B₄` shell comparison report and exposed its verdict
    through the repo-facing validation summary without routing it through the
    admissible rigidity harness.
  - added `Docs/OrbitShellProfilesAndLorentzSignature.md` as the canonical
    repo-facing note for the current orbit-shell / Lorentz-signature framing.
  - added a typed `B₄` promotion-status surface with current status
    `standaloneOnly`.
  - refined the `B₄` comparison so it now classifies shell-neighborhood status;
    the current independent `B₄` realization lands in the definite shell class
    `[8] / [24]`, so the blocker to admissible Lorentz promotion is structural,
    not just pending orientation/signature plumbing.
  - next algebraic step selected:
    add a finite orbit-shell generating series from orientation plus shell-1 /
    shell-2 multiplicities, use it for the theorem-backed shift witness and a
    standalone `B₄` comparison, and add only a prototype wave lift at grade 0.
  - next theorem step selected:
    promote shell-neighborhood class to a first-class API, add a bounded
    one-minus shell-family theorem for `m = 2..8`, then push to a parametric
    `m` family layer, then a full parametric theorem, before resuming the
    search for another Lorentz-family realization.
- current closure hardening target:
  keep the canonical Stage C path and the empirical full adapter on the same
  concrete constraint-closure witness, instead of leaving the empirical full
  adapter on a trivial compatibility shim.
- current newest physics-first widening now landed:
  stronger local recovery beyond the current coherence slice with a broader
  extended local recovery theorem,
  plus a stronger algebraic-coherence theorem beyond the current
  package-parametric bridge.
- that next physics-first widening is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-local-regime theorem above the current local
  physics-coherence slice,
  and one stronger algebraic-stability theorem above the current
  algebraic-coherence slice.
- that next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-dynamics theorem above the current complete-local
  regime slice,
  one stronger algebraic-consistency theorem above the current
  algebraic-bundle/stability slice,
  one geometry-facing downstream consumer on the canonical ladder,
  and one richer moonshine comparison bundle on the prototype track.
- current next physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-geometry theorem above the current
  recovered-wavefront slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-invariance theorem above the current
  transport-invariance slice,
  one wave-geometry-facing downstream consumer on the canonical ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave family summary on the prototype
  track.
- current newest physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-regime theorem above the current
  recovered-wave-geometry slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-persistence theorem above the current
  regime-invariance slice,
  one wave-regime-facing downstream consumer on the canonical ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave-regime summary on the prototype
  track.
- current latest physics-first cycle is now landed:
  one stronger recovered-wave-observables theorem above the current
  recovered-wave-regime slice,
  one stronger algebraic regime-coherence theorem above the current
  regime-persistence slice,
  one wave-observable-facing downstream consumer on the canonical ladder,
  and one richer moonshine twined-wave-observable summary on the prototype
  track.
  - current closure-hardening gain:
    `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CanonicalStageC` now makes the authoritative
    minimum-credible closure path explicit in code, while legacy/prototype
    surfaces remain non-canonical.
  - next theorem-backed validation gain:
    observable-space collapse can now be surfaced from the existing
    `RealClosureKitFiber.obsFixed` / `obsUnique` shift witnesses.
  - refactored the intrinsic shell/orbit theorem boundary so theorem-critical
    records no longer mention finite realization fields; the finite
    enumeration bridge remains on the shift-instance side.
  - tightened the Stage C closure boundary with explicit authoritative-dynamics
    accessors and a minimum-credible spin/Dirac entrypoint.

- Physics bridge stubs were added under `DASHI/Physics/` to mirror the remaining “unproven” list with minimal records/postulates.
- A new `AdmissibleQuadratic` interface now bundles contraction, isotropy, involution, and finite-speed invariances; uniqueness is the intended bottleneck.
- Shared symmetry definitions (`Isotropy`, `PreservesQuadratic`) live in `DASHI/Physics/Core.agda`.
- Current milestone: remove remaining postulates in `DASHI/Physics/*` by providing concrete witnesses and wiring to existing bridge modules.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/SignatureLockCSVEvidence.agda` to connect masked‑Q rank evidence to `SignatureLock` (no export changes).
- Fixed `EmpiricalClosureWithWitnessPolicy` universe by parameterizing on witness set.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/EmpiricalClosureWithSignatureLock.agda` to bundle empirical closure with witness policy and signature‑lock evidence.
- Masked Orthogonal Split (empirical gate: PASS) in 3D closure embedding (`v_pnorm, v_dnorm, v_arrow`) with quadratic `G = diag([-1, 0.2034, -1])` and projector onto shape coords: self‑adjoint error 0, max cross term 2.396e−16, max split residual 6.661e−16.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Cone/ArrowSeparatedDeltaConeSplit.agda` and re-export module to connect arrow-separated delta cone with masked orthogonal split, plus `forwardConeSplit`.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Cone/ArrowSeparatedDeltaConeSplitShift.agda` (shift wiring for cone+split bridge).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureEmpiricalWithConeSplit.agda` (bundle adds cone-split gate to empirical closure).
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/CompleteUltrametric.agda` and `DASHI/Geometry/BanachFixedPoint.agda` (completeness + Banach fixed point interfaces for ℕ‑ultrametrics).
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/CompleteUltrametricNat.agda` (constructive completeness for any ℕ‑valued ultrametric using ε=1).
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/BanachFixedPointNat.agda` (banachFromStrict wrapper).
- Added `DASHI/Metric/CompleteAgreementUltrametric.agda` and `DASHI/Metric/CompleteFineAgreementUltrametric.agda` (completeness instances for LCP ultrametrics).

- Added `DASHI/Geometry/LCP/NatGlue.agda` with basic Nat inequalities used in Banach‑LCP plumbing.
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/LCP/ContractiveCompose.agda` and `DASHI/Geometry/LCP/TContractiveDepth.agda` (composition lemma + κ‑contractive T skeleton).

- Added `DASHI/Physics/SeverityGuardedStrict.agda` (adapter from SeverityPolicy to guarded strictness interface).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/SeverityGuardShiftInstance.agda` (shift carrier severity policy + guarded strictness bundle, parameterized by code/thresholds/restore).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/SeverityGuardShiftWiring.agda` (shift wiring that takes a concrete severity policy and builds a guarded strictness bundle).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/SeverityMapping.agda` (severity mapping from tail countNZ; thresholds safe=3, broken=4).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/MaassRestorationShift.agda` (restore = embedCoarse ∘ coarseOf).
- Added `DASHI/Physics/SeverityGuardShiftConcrete.agda` (concrete wiring with postulates for `P-strict-on` and restoration laws; compiles).
- `MaassRestorationShift` now proves `restore-idem` and `tailOf-restore`; `restore-normal-form''` is discharged via tail=0 and countNZ-replicate-zer.
- Remaining postulate: `P-strict-on` (strictness under Guard with real LCP stream).
- Decision: switch strictness target to **FineAgreement ultrametric** (`dNatFine`) and discharge via `RealOperatorStackShift.strictP-fiber`. LCP path remains intact; new FineAgreement guarded strictness modules will be added.
- Added FineAgreement guarded strictness modules:
  - `DASHI/Physics/TailCollapseGuardedStrictFine.agda`
  - `DASHI/Physics/SeverityGuardedStrictFine.agda`
  - `DASHI/Physics/SeverityGuardShiftInstanceFine.agda`

- Extended `Contraction.agda` with `StrictContraction` (contractive + unique fixed point).
- Repo fully typechecks against stdlib; ternary carrier + agreement ultrametric are concrete and postulate-free.
- Real operator stack now uses tail-zeroing projection `Pᵣ` and fine-agreement ultrametric; nontrivial isotropy (C₂ sign-flip) and finite-speed (ball locality) are wired.
- Strict contraction and fixed-point claims are now framed via **fiber/quotient contraction**: added `FiberContraction` and `RealClosureKitFiber`, and `TernaryRealInstance` provides observable fixed/unique on tail digit.
- Remaining global StrictContraction path is still available but not used for the real ternary instance; physics closure now uses the fiber kit.
- Next milestone focuses on canonicalization on the coarse core and a quadratic invariant; signature/orthogonality are introduced as named assumption targets.

- Replaced `orbitProfile` postulate with concrete `OrbitProfileExternal.orbitProfile-m6`.
- Added `RealCausalStructureNontrivial` (delta = x, order = Qσ≥0) and wired into `TernaryRealInstanceShift`.

2026-02-23:
- Added `MaskedOrthogonalSplitConstructive` with constructive core⊥tail under B2σ and dotσ, no postulates; module typechecks.
2026-02-24 (planned next):

- Replace external orbit profile with a concrete generator (Shell1 enumeration) and wire into `TernaryRealInstanceShift`.

- Captured full scan table in `.planning/ORBIT_PROFILE_DATA.md`.
- Added `DASHI/Physics/OrbitProfileComputed.agda` (internal shell orbit profile computation for Bool action) and wired `TernaryRealInstanceShift` to use it.
2026-02-24 plan (next):

- Keep Bool isotropy wired until tail-perm commutation/metric-preservation proofs are constructed.
2026-03-01 update:
- Assumption-pack burn-down completed (postulate-free):
  - `OrbitFingerprintAssumptionsPostulates`: removed `MinimalOrbit`; `StableSignature` definitional (`m ≡ 4`); `Saturation` is identity.
  - `DimensionBoundAssumptionsPostulates`: `isotropyShellProfile` is concrete (external profile table by `m`);
    `OrbitProfile-24-6-2→m≡4` proved by case split on `m`;

2026-02-24 update (closure surface skeletons):
- Added quadratic emergence, cone/signature, constraint closure, MDL, defect→curvature, instances, and closure harness modules (see `DASHI/Geometry/*`, `DASHI/Physics/Constraints/*`, `DASHI/MDL/*`, `DASHI/Instances/*`, `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosure.agda`).
2026-02-24 update:
- Hardcoded `allPerms` for k=4 in `DASHI/Physics/OrbitProfileComputedTailPerm.agda` to remove the remaining postulate in that module.
2026-02-24 note:
- Tail-permutation isotropy is incompatible with `Rᵣ/Pᵣ` commutation (shiftTail/projTail). Need to keep Bool isotropy for the closure spine or change operators/restrict group.

- Added `MDLDescentShiftInstance.agda` and re-exported via `ShiftEnergyMDLInstances`.
2026-02-24 update:
- Added `DASHI/Energy/FejerToClosestPoint.agda` (single-seam bridge from Fejér to closest-point).
- `closestShift` now derives via that bridge from a single axiom (`closestAxiomShift`).
2026-02-25 update:
- Added `DASHI/Geometry/OrthogonalityFromPolarization.agda` to state the quadratic+polarization ⇒ orthogonality corollary seam.
2026-02-25 update:

- Filled the closest-point seam partially: `EnergyClosestPointShiftInstance` now builds `closestAxiomsShift` from `fejerShift` and a single lemma `fejer⇒closestShift`.
2026-02-25 update:
- Added empirical interpretation note: Fejér/closest-point descent (MDL proxy) is the intended contraction geometry; χ² space is not globally contractive. Comments added to `DASHI/MDL/MDLDescentTradeoff.agda` and `DASHI/Energy/ClosestPoint.agda`.
2026-02-25 update:

- Added witness set policy contract: `DASHI/Physics/WitnessSetPolicy.agda` (min forward/backward + quota-preserving snap).

## 2026-03-08 (Parametric theorem + χ²/snap validation)
- Landed a real parametric shell-1 theorem in
  `DASHI/Physics/OneMinusShellFamilyParametric.agda`.
- Added a concrete shift-side χ²-boundary witness in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Validation/Chi2BoundaryShiftWitness.agda`.
- Expanded that witness into a small typed library in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Validation/Chi2BoundaryShiftLibrary.agda`.
- Added a typed snap-threshold benchmark surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Validation/SnapThresholdLaw*.agda`.
- Exposed the parametric theorem and snap-threshold verdict through
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`.
- Added an independent synthetic one-minus shell-side realization and
  standalone comparison surface:
  `DASHI/Physics/SyntheticOneMinusShellRealization.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Validation/SyntheticOneMinusShellComparison.agda`.
- Extended that synthetic one-minus candidate to carry matching shell-1 and
  shell-2 profiles, then bridged orientation/signature and added a minimal
  independent-dynamics witness so it can enter the admissible harness.
- Added a prototype-only Lorentz-neighborhood dynamic candidate scaffold:
  `DASHI/Physics/LorentzNeighborhoodDynamicCandidate.agda`.
- Next strengthening step selected:
  add a typed synthetic-promotion bridge so the exact orientation/signature
  blocker is explicit in code, and add a structured status surface to the
  canonical shift dynamics package.
- Synthetic promotion status has now landed:
  orientation/signature are bridged on the current synthetic profile path,
  a minimal independent-dynamics witness is present, and the synthetic
  one-minus candidate now serves as the canonical admissible alternate
  realization with `exactMatch`.
- Canonical Stage C now also exports:
  a semantics-bearing dynamics witness companion,
  a concrete canonical constraint-closure status surface,
  a known-limits status surface for the broader physics runway,
  the first scoped known-limits recovery witness,
  and the witness-bearing canonical spin/Dirac consumer surface.
- Canonical Stage C now also exports:
  a concrete minimal constraint-closure witness,
  and a stronger known-limits recovery witness carrying actual propagation and
  effective-geometry witnesses on the canonical shift path.
- Canonical Stage C now also exports:
  a minimal algebraic-closure theorem for the concrete three-generator system,
  a scoped local-recovery theorem for the current local Lorentz +
  propagation slice,
  and a scoped effective-geometry theorem for that same regime.
- Next runway theorem order:
  scoped gauge-contract theorem first,
  then scoped spin/local-Lorentz bridge theorem.
- Both scoped runway theorems are now landed on the canonical Stage C path.
- The next widening beyond those scoped slices is now landed:
  a carrier-parametric gauge/constraint theorem with the current concrete
  closure carrier as its first instance,
  a second realized carrier instance for that theorem,
  and a local causal-effective propagation theorem on the current recovery
  baseline, plus a further local geometry-transport theorem.
- The next widening after that is:
  a package-parametric gauge-constraint bridge theorem,
  plus a local causal-geometry coherence theorem above the transport slice.
- Those widening slices are now landed.
  The next physics-first widening is:
  a broader local recovery theorem beyond the current coherence slice,
  followed by a less toy algebraic closure theorem beyond the current
  package-parametric bridge.
- Current moonshine-facing prototype:
  finite graded shell series,
  finite signed/Weyl shell actions,
  twined fixed-point traces for shift and `B₄`,
  and a wave grading adapter kept explicitly prototype-only.
- Richer twiner libraries and a first graded/twined comparison report are now
  landed; next hardening is broader twiner coverage and a richer comparison
  summary, then a stronger wave-grading summary, still without any modularity
  or umbral claim.
