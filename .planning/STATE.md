# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Every new lemma must land in Agda with a machine-checked bridge between the quantum and GR sectors.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Closure Harness

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Closure Harness)
Plan: 06-01 of 2
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Added concrete severity mapping/restoration + shift wiring (with postulated P‑strict/restore laws)

Progress: [█████████░] 92%

- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Use L1/MDL/proximal geometry as the primary contraction layer.
- Treat snap events as a formal exception class (not noise).
- Keep quadratic/signature layers as explicit stubs until discriminators are wired.

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Need a concrete, guard-based `P-strict` witness for the real shift projection (tail collapse) in the LCP-depth language.
- Need to pick the guard predicate (`NotSnap`/first-difference) and show it is reached/preserved by `T`.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-01
Stopped at: `SeverityGuardShiftConcrete` compiles; remaining postulate is guarded strictness `P-strict-on` only.
