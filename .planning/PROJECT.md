# Quantum  :  GR Unification Formalization

## What This Is
A focused Agda project to mechanize the missing theorems that make the DASHI Quantum : General-Relativistic unification a full constructive proof rather than a narrative sketch. The goal is to close the remaining proof obligations (Stone theorem, Bianchi, Dirac closure, UV bounds, Lorentz dimension uniqueness, anomaly freedom) so the QUADRATIC-DEFECT / Worldsheet modules can be trusted for downstream dependents.

## Core Value
Every new lemma must land in Agda with a machine-checked bridge between the quantum and GR sectors; if a theorem stays informal, the unification claim stays invalid.

## Requirements

### Validated
- [x] Stone’s theorem / strong continuity of `U(t)` over the already-defined Hilbert structure and self-adjoint Hamiltonians.
  Structured `StoneBundle` to expose a `StoneGroup`, `StoneContinuity`, and `StoneSelfAdjoint` witness plus a user-supplied `distance`. Assumes the supplied metric on `HS.H` behaves like a norm and the generator is self-adjoint via the Hilbert inner-product.
- [x] Mechanized Bianchi-to-Einstein bridge that packages the Bianchi identities, conservation, and defect-to-Einstein correspondence.
  `Geometry` now exposes `BianchiFirst/Second` and `divergenceFree`, `Matter` is parameterized by the geometry’s base set, and `BianchiBundle/BianchiConsequences` fold those into a concrete implication of the Einstein tensor matching the matter tensor.
- [x] Dirac constraint algebra closure from valuation equivariance and no-leakage stability.
  `ConstraintClosureBundle` now turns the Valuation and Stability witnesses into a `DiracClosureType` via `ConstraintAlgebraTheoremType`, and `ConstraintConsequences` packages the derived `mom-mom`/`ham-mom`/`ham-ham` triple for downstream use.
- [x] UV finiteness from the holographic area bound.
  `AgreementDepthBundle` now carries `AreaBound` data; `AgreementDepth-theorem` applies `UVFinitenessTheorem` to produce a `UVFinite` witness and `AgreementConsequences` bundles the bound plus the induced finiteness record.
- [x] Lorentz signature uniqueness packaged via `LorentzInterval`.
  `SignatureBundle` now carries explicit `signature-proof` and `p3-uniqueness` witnesses, and `Signature-uniqueness` reuses those consequences alongside the scaling-stability hypothesis for the eventual dimension classification.
- [x] Skeleton bridge modules capturing the foundational proofs outlined in `.planning/CONTEXT.md`.
  Added `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionContractiveConstant`, `DASHI.Geometry.NoLeakageOrthogonality`, `DASHI.Geometry.ParallelogramToInnerProduct`, `DASHI.Algebra.Clifford.UniversalProperty`, `DASHI.Algebra.Quantum.SpinFromEvenClifford`, `DASHI.Geometry.EinsteinFromRGNoLeakage`, `DASHI.Algebra.Quantum.CCRFromProjection`, `DASHI.Algebra.Quantum.UVFiniteness`, and `DASHI.Geometry.Signature31AndDim3` so the pipeline from contraction to Clifford/Spin to Einstein/CCR/UVfiniteness and dimension uniqueness is explicit.
- [x] Constraint-anomaly freedom tying Stone, agreement depth, and constraint closure together.
  `AnomalyBundle` now yields `AnomalyConsequences` with the Stone group, Dirac closure, UV-finiteness, and anomaly-free witness stitched together so the CCR + constraint + UV tower story is tracked in one record.
- [x] De-stubbed bridge scaffolding (Clifford/Spin, CCR, UV, signature, orthogonality).
  Clifford universal property now requires an explicit anti-commutation proof; Spin double cover requires kernel/surjectivity data; NoLeakageOrthogonality is parameterised over an inner-product structure without metas; UV finiteness is proved from a supplied bound; signature/dimension closure is purely data-driven (no reflexive defaults).
- [x] RG→Einstein and anomaly data de-stubbed.
  `EinsteinFromRGNoLeakage` now depends on an explicit `RGGeometryData` bundle (no postulates), and `AnomalyFreedom` requires concrete cubic/mixed anomaly values with cancellation proofs in its bundle.

### Active
- Physics closure pass: add real-closure scaffolds (T-operator, strict contraction composition, real isotropy, real finite-speed, closure instance) and wire them into the closure spine; replace toy witnesses once the real operator and locality are fixed.

### Out of Scope
- Spinor / gauge-field principal bundles and SM representations (deferred until the bridge theorems and background independence exist).
- Heavier metric / manifold zoning not already present in the existing DASHI differential-geometry scaffolding.

## Context
- Bridge modules are all inhabited with concrete (minimal) models; localized `agda -i . -i /usr/share/agda/lib/stdlib` checks now succeed for the added files.
- Stdlib path remains `/usr/share/agda/lib/stdlib`; modules compile against that toolchain.

## Constraints
- **Agda tooling**: Proofs must compile with the existing stdlib path and avoid changing the compiler version (Agda 2.6.x assumed).
- **Scope**: Prioritize the six bridge-theorem targets before any new quantum-field or bundle treatments; each addition must justify how it helps the unification claim.

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Prioritize bridging theorems over gauge/matter completeness | The checklist called these the “true QG parts,” and failing to mechanize them invalidates the unification | — Pending |
