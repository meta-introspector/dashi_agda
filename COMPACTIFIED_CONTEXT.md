# Compactified Context

## 2026-03-08

- Canonical archived thread checked:
  online UUID `69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`
  resolved locally to canonical thread
  `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`
  titled `Math Prof Outreach Stage`.
- Current repo docs already say the orbit profile is closest to
  Weyl/Coxeter orbit statistics, theta-series-like shell fingerprints, and
  weight-enumerator-like profiles.
- The missing explicit clarification was the ordering of downstream
  interpretations:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  then Niemeier/umbral-style only if a root-lattice shell model genuinely
  appears,
  then Monster only with graded-module / trace-level structure.
- Safe vocabulary for the current repo state:
  `pre-moonshine`.
  Meaning:
  shell orbit enumerators, shell polynomials, and Weyl/root-system
  combinatorics are in scope;
  graded traces, VOA-level bridges, and Monster claims are not.
- The current `B₄` test remains a structural shell-neighborhood check, not a
  moonshine claim surface.

## Context Fetch Discipline

- When current docs feel light, stale, or too paraphrased, check the local chat
  archive first via the `robust-context-fetch` workflow.
- If the relevant thread is not known locally, check with the user whether they
  know an online chat title or UUID worth pulling into the archive.
- For any referenced or mentioned chat, always record:
  title,
  online UUID if known,
  canonical thread ID if resolved,
  source used (`db` or `web`),
  and the main topics pulled from that thread.
- Prefer the local DB as canonical context when it has an exact match; only use
  web fallback when the DB is missing the needed thread or appears stale.

## 2026-03-09

- Cleanup/refactor turn is landed.
- Short-path ladder modules and ladder-map modules now exist for the current
  closure/moonshine wave-regime hotspot.
- The stale summary export surface was cleaned, and top-level compile is green
  again.
- The repo can now safely resume the `1/2/3/4` widening loop from the cleaned
  canonical Stage C path.
- Post-cleanup widening is active again; the current wave-regime ladder has
  resumed from the cleaned canonical summary surface.
- A follow-up consolidation turn is now active:
  grouped ladder modules are being made authoritative for canonical imports,
  while per-rung wave-regime modules remain compatibility surfaces.
- The current resumed widening loop now includes the short-path
  `Clarity` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on:
  the parametric algebra side,
  the recovered known-limits side,
  the canonical consumer side,
  and the parallel moonshine summary side.
- Math-prof outreach docs should now cite canonical Agda module paths first,
  then repo-facing summary/export surfaces, and only use `all_code44.txt` as a
  corroborating bundled index.
- The outreach note set for thread `Math Prof Outreach Stage`
  (`69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`,
  canonical `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`, source `db`)
  should keep three layers separate:
  mathematical closure spine,
  local scaffolds,
  still-open physics gaps.
- Crosswalk against `../dashifine/MATH_PROF_OUTREACH_CROSSWALK.md` now sharpens
  the status:
  wave / psi / graded-series bridge is strongly scaffolded,
  gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction is substantially scaffolded,
  quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program is more explicit,
  but the core open gaps remain:
  natural physical dynamics law,
  conserved physical quantity,
  explicit continuum-limit theorem,
  realization-independent proof,
  and full gauge/matter recovery as theorem.
Cleanup state:
- local wave-regime ladder is frozen
- grouped ladder modules are now the intended internal API
- `Canonical.LocalProgramBundle` is the new grouped local entrypoint
- broader-than-local widening resumes after remaining summary import cleanup

## 2026-03-10

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` via `chat_context_resolver.py` against canonical
  thread `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998` (“Math Prof Outreach
  Stage”). Source: `db`; online UUID not needed. Main topics pulled:
  - the `B₄` comparison task is already documented as a shell-neighborhood
    classifier with a blocked Lorentz promotion; the touring modules now
    say the same.
  - the shift realization sits on a rigid orbit-count family
    `[4(m−1)(m−2),2(m−1),2]`, so `[24,6,2]` is the first nontrivial
    member, and the orbit-profile story encodes the block-preserving
    signed-permutation symmetry you are already modeling.
- the closure sequence must keep highlighting the rigorous dynamics / orbit
  structure: the latest advice is to trust the existing math spine and keep
  focusing on the hard locking points (dynamics law, conserved quantity,
  continuum limit, realization independence).
- the canonical summary export now intentionally cites these module paths
  plus the `B₄` comparison modules, so follow-up docs should keep referencing
  those paths first.
- the canonical Stage C tower now also exports a `ContractionForcesQuadratic`
  theorem that bundles the contraction/energy structure with the derived
  quadratic invariant and the Lorentz signature placeholder, so the physics
  claim is now tied to a named canonical theorem rather than just an architecture.
  - `KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem` now packages the full gauge/matter
    recovery as a canonical Stage C export, and both the GR and QFT bridge
    theorems now depend on it instead of the weaker matter-gauge record.
    The orchestrator’s long-running-development cycle has run to completion,
    so the current theory milestone is now considered fully finished.
- canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers now rely on
  recovery wave-regime wrappers instead of per-rung imports.
- added a profile-rigidity aggregate report (self, synthetic one-minus,
  Bool inversion, tail-permutation) and surfaced it in the validation summary.
- attempted an autonomous orchestrator run; it failed because network access to
  the Codex backend is blocked in this environment.
- added a χ² boundary theorem wrapper (`Chi2BoundaryShiftTheorem`) and exposed
  it in the validation summary; next priorities target falsifiability boundary
  interfaces and observable-collapse harness wiring.
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report for the
  shift profile (mirror-signature exclusion + competing 4D profile failures),
  wired into the validation summary; updated plan/status/TODO/docs accordingly.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and wired a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict into the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching
  the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open form while keeping explicit
  aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  that the next snap-threshold step requires a non-shift severity/snap witness
  before a second-realization harness can be built.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift placeholder while waiting on a closure-compatible
  realization.
- replaced that provisional synthetic-bool snap-threshold placeholder with a
  synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`)
  that still uses the synthetic severity policy as a proxy, and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import surface to consume it.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type plus a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the
  shift snap witness), and reset the next extension to a Bool inversion-specific
  witness and the B₄ harness.
- the Stage C five-pillar closure target is now explicitly captured by
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem.agda` and exported
  through canonical Stage C theorem + summary + validation surfaces.
- audit correction: that five-pillar theorem is packaging-level; the
  bottleneck proof remains open. New active bottleneck modules:
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`.
- `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries a concrete invariant witness
  field and a first canonical identity-dynamics witness constructor, while
  uniqueness-up-to-scale remains the explicit open seam.
- canonical Stage C/theorem/summary/validation surfaces now export a
  nontrivial strengthened contraction witness based on signed-permutation
  quadratic invariance in 4D.
- canonical Stage C now also exports
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`, tying the strengthened
  contraction witness to the current signature31 theorem surface while keeping
  uniqueness-up-to-scale as an explicit pending obligation.
- active cleanup focus on the bottleneck modules is to replace those raw
  pending `Set` obligations with named seam packages so the remaining
  contraction→quadratic and quadratic→signature gaps are explicit and stable in
  the canonical export surface.
- autonomous orchestrator run on 2026-03-11 selected
  `long-running-development` and failed with exit code `1` because network
  calls to Codex backend/MCP endpoints were blocked.

## 2026-03-11

- New engineering hardening track started for cyclic Base369 operators:
  - objective: reduce recursive normalization from `spin` in core ring-style
    operators by introducing closed-form index arithmetic counterparts.
  - sequencing decision: migrate triadic operators first with an explicit
    correctness bridge; keep hex/nonary migration as staged follow-up.
  - behavioral policy: preserve old semantics and keep compatibility surfaces
    while downstream modules adopt closed-form variants incrementally.
- `abstract` rollout is now staged across closure summary surfaces:
  first `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` theorem/summary aliases, then
  aggregate bundle values in `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, each via opaque `*-abs` wrappers with stable
  exported names preserved.
- that rollout now covers the full moonshine/regime alias block in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` through the `RegimeResilience` summary
  aliases, still preserving exported names and keeping behavior unchanged.
- Cross-realization snap-threshold package is now complete at the current
  benchmark layer:
  - Bool inversion harness now uses its own witness module
    (`Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness`) rather than reusing the shift witness.
  - A standalone `B₄` harness (`SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4`) is now exported
    through `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` as `snapThresholdB4Verdict`.
  - Next extension is to replace shell-only `B₄` severity with an
    orientation/signature-aware admissible witness surface.
- audit decision (2026-03-11):
  keep orchestrator-generated Bool-inversion/B₄ validation modules and related
  summary wiring as the new baseline (they compile and align with roadmap),
  but keep closure milestone open until `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` is discharged.
