# Compactified Context

## 2026-03-27

- Upstream PR `#1` (`nix support`) is now treated as the active source merge
  target for the missing Agda surface in this checkout.
- The specific PR payload to bring in is the new Agda/modules and perf wiring:
  `Kernel/KAlgebra.agda`, `Monster/MUltrametric.agda`,
  `Moonshine.agda`, `MoonshineEarn.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`,
  `PerfHistory.agda`, `perf_da51.py`, and the import rewrites that point the
  existing modules at those names.
- The current local tree still has the merge-prep tooling surface, and now has
  the PR `#1` Agda source and generated artifacts that are required by the main
  import graph.
- Confirmed the sibling Lean repo `../dashi_lean4` is present locally at
  `/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_lean4`.
- Current contents are a small Lean-side perf/CBOR bridge rather than a full
  formal mirror:
  `Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `MoonshineEarn.lean`,
  and `DashiPerf/{Schema,Audit,Sample100,Sample101,Sample102}.lean`.
- Use it as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema witness and perf-ingest target,
  not as the missing DASL class/projection layer or as a replacement for the
  AGDA source anchor.
- This does not change the earlier bridge decision:
  `../kant-zk-pastebin` remains the source-side anchor, and `../dashi_lean4`
  remains an auxiliary Lean witness repo.

## 2026-03-25

- Applied `zkp-problem-framing`, `get-shit-done`, and
  `autonomous-orchestrator` to the remaining repo backlog.
- Durable framing result:
  the repo is past setup churn; the active work is the physics-closure spine
  and canonical export cleanup, governed by
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`.
- Added `Docs/AutonomousOrchestratorClosureFrame.md` as the durable
  orchestration/frame note for this phase.
- Normalized `status.json` to the autonomous-orchestrator control vocabulary.
  Current intended route:
  `autonomous-orchestrator` control plane -> `long-running-development`
  child skill.
- Validation guardrail remains unchanged:
  treat `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and full `Everything.agda`
  runs as checkpoint-only because they remain too heavy for routine loops.

## 2026-03-23

- Review of upstream PR `#1` (`nix support`) showed the main technical gap is
  not the presence of the demo JSONL files themselves, but the fact that the
  proposed `flake` coverage only walks top-level `*.agda` plus
  `Verification/`, while the repo and the PR both add meaningful Agda surface
  under `Kernel/` and `Monster/`.
- Merge-prep decision for the local repo:
  keep demo DA51/zkperf JSONL artifacts acceptable in principle for now if
  they are explicitly documented as illustrative witness data rather than
  reproducibility-critical source inputs.
- The actual merge hardening target is therefore:
  add a local `flake`/`agda-lib` surface whose authoritative check mirrors the
  existing GitHub action on `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and add a second
  recursive smoke surface covering the merge-relevant standalone roots plus
  recursive `Kernel/`, `Monster/`, and `Verification/` modules.
- That local merge surface is now concretized by `flake.nix`,
  `dashi-agda.agda-lib`,
  `scripts/list_merge_agda_targets.sh`, and
  `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh`.
- The same merge-relevant recursive target surface should drive
  `agda-record-all`, so future perf/witness collection does not silently omit
  nested modules while pretending to represent the whole repo.
- Current merge-policy decision:
  do not force JSONL sanitization in this pass;
  instead document those demo artifacts as non-authoritative and keep the real
  technical requirement on recursive check/record coverage.
- Merge-prep closeout:
  the local Nix / zkperf surface is now implemented, locked, validated, and
  pushed; future attention returns to the physics closure and tail-boundary
  priorities already tracked elsewhere in the repo.

## 2026-03-22

- Canonical archived thread checked:
  title `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`,
  online UUID `69bf03e8-7634-839b-a9fd-74ed3616943f`,
  canonical thread `cff5c44711a788e01cdbadd98a72822ce1bb8786`,
  source `db`.
- Main repo-facing wording correction from that thread:
  Monster-labeled proof artifacts should not be described as forming a distinct
  global cluster or unique fingerprint under the current exponent embedding.
- Safe claim boundary for symmetry-adjacent anomaly reports:
  the current embedding may reveal a small low-variance rigid substructure, but
  that structure is not yet unique to Monster-labeled samples and should be
  framed as non-discriminative unless baseline/control comparisons separate it.
- Repo docs/TODOs should therefore keep Monster/Moonshine language downstream
  of a real graded-module / trace bridge and avoid upgrading rigid-slot
  observations into theorem-grade self-reference claims.
- Additional decision from the same thread content:
  the current DA51 / exponent-vector embedding is behaving primarily as a
  representation-level structural encoding, not a semantic discriminator for
  Monster-labeled proofs.
- Interpretation split now made explicit:
  JMD-side questions should use static regime/classification features such as
  `eigenspace`, `bott`, `Hecke`, `orbifold`, `DA51`, and `j-fixed`;
  DASHI-side questions should use dynamic/trace features such as `Δx`,
  cone compatibility, contraction/Fejér behavior, and trajectory admissibility.
- The `p47` / `j-fixed` slot should currently be treated as a baseline gauge
  normalization or structural constraint, not as a Monster-specific signal.
- Next validation order from this thread:
  first a JMD regime-occupancy/divergence test on matched Monster vs control
  modules, then a DASHI delta-regime test on source-vs-trace behavior.
- DASHI-side cone rewrite is now sharper:
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` learns admissible ternary signatures on
  structural axes and treats the arrow axis as a separate monotonicity guard.
- Direct run on
  `../dashifine/hepdata_lyapunov_test_out/dashi_idk_out.csv/closure_embedding_per_step.csv`
  with the `dashifine-closure-embedding` preset now gives:
  `structural_cone_pass_rate=1.0`,
  `arrow_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  `joint_pass_rate=0.9333`.
- Current diagnosis:
  the structural cone is empirically intact on that trace family; the residual
  failures are localized `v_arrow` monotonicity violations on
  `phistar_50_76`, not diffuse geometric breakdown.
- Ultrametric/ternary follow-up is now landed in the same harness:
  those `phistar_50_76` failures keep the same admissible structural ternary
  signature, have zero nearest-signature distance, and show up as arrow-only
  boundary cases with max ultrametric radius under the current bucket scheme.
- Arrow-guard sweep is now landed too.
  On the same `dashifine` trace:
  `eps=1e-4` lifts joint pass to `0.95`,
  `eps=1e-3` lifts it to `0.9667`,
  `eps=1e-2` lifts it to `0.9833`,
  and `eps=1e-1` clears all remaining boundary cases.
- The four current localized `phistar_50_76` boundary steps require minimum
  arrow tolerances of about:
  `3.99867e-05`, `8.11219e-04`, `8.13658e-03`, and `7.97279e-02`.
- Boundary/interior split is now explicit in the local harness:
  the checked `dashifine` trace currently classifies as
  `56` interior steps and `4` `arrow_boundary` steps,
  with no structural-boundary or outside-class cases.
- A canonical arrow-profile layer is now landed in the same harness:
  `strict` keeps `arrow_eps=0`,
  `boundary` uses `arrow_eps=1e-2`,
  and `lenient` uses `arrow_eps=1e-1`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace those profiles yield:
  `strict -> 56 interior / 4 arrow_boundary`,
  `boundary -> 59 interior / 1 arrow_boundary`,
  `lenient -> 60 interior`.
- The cone harness can now also write a stable arrow-boundary artifact to
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_latest.csv`;
  on the current direct `dashifine` run that artifact contains the four
  localized `phistar_50_76` boundary steps.
- The missing JMD-side dataset is now partially landed as a local builder:
  `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` scans the Agda tree and emits
  `artifacts/regime_test/jmd_regime_table.csv`.
- First builder run produced `844` rows total with `7` Monster rows and `6`
  matched control rows.
- That builder is now seeded via `data/regime_test/jmd_regime_seed.csv` and
  no longer emits an all-`<missing>` matched table.
  Current matched occupancy read is:
  `eigenspace JS=0.5569`,
  `bott JS=0.0608`,
  `joint(eigenspace,bott,hecke) JS=0.6176`,
  with the permutation/classification pass now restricted to the actual
  `M/O` comparison rows.
- The execution-admissibility bridge is now implemented too:
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` can export
  `artifacts/regime_test/execution_admissibility_latest.json`,
  `artifacts/regime_test/eigen_overlap_latest.csv`,
  and a generated Agda witness module
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness.agda`.
- New parallel Agda surface:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` is now a separate witness layer from
  `DynamicalClosureWitness`, threaded through
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness` and exposed from
  `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure` without breaking the broader closure stack.
  That parallel witness surface now includes both the step-level execution
  witness and the family-level classification witness, so
  `MDLTailBoundaryFamily` is no longer only a Python artifact.
- Current strict-profile execution witness read:
  `56` `Interior`,
  `4` `ArrowBoundary`,
  `0` `StructuralBoundary`,
  `0` `Outside`.
  The current trace-derived eigen overlap remains coverage-limited and
  provisional; on the checked `dashifine` trace it currently operates in
  `trace` mode with no JMD match coverage for those HEPData labels.
- New source-side bridge clarification:
  the explicit DASL / Monster source anchor is now identified in the sibling
  repo `../kant-zk-pastebin`, not in the Agda tree itself.
  In particular:
  `src/dasl.rs` fixes the `0xDA51` address grammar, Monster prime basis, Hecke
  list, attack triple `(47,59,71)`, and orbifold coordinates in
  `Z/71 × Z/59 × Z/47`;
  `src/sheaf.rs` adds `EigenSpace`, encoding-to-prime mapping, Bott/Hecke
  address fields, and DASL section/address packaging;
  `src/ipfs.rs` wraps content in a DASL/CBOR envelope carrying orbifold and
  DASL address metadata.
- Lean-side cross-check:
  the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` exists locally and still does not close
  the current JMD-side gap. It is useful as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema
  witness (`Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `DashiPerf/Schema.lean`,
  `DashiPerf/Audit.lean`), but it does not provide the missing class/projection
  layer: no DASL address grammar, no `EigenSpace` / `Earth|Spoke|Hub|Clock`,
  no Bott/Hecke/orbifold class table, and no class-level source projection for
  the HEPData trace families.
- Current bridge reading after that code check:
  `kant-zk-pastebin` supplies the source-side `Σ_src` anchor for
  source/basin/eigen questions,
  while the local `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` remains the execution-side
  contract layer.
  This means:
  the next implementation step is not a new structural cone learner, but a
  loader/projection path from `scripts/regime_test.py` into the DASL source
  model so `basin_ok` and `eigen_ok` stop depending only on trace or seeded JMD
  proxies.
- Claim boundary remains strict:
  the sibling repo provides an explicit source lattice grammar and semantic
  address structure, but not a finished class table or a proof that DASHI
  projection preserves the `p47`/gauge slot automatically.
  Any such gauge-compatibility claim remains provisional until the trace is
  actually projected into that lattice and checked.
- That first source-backed trace check is now landed in
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  The harness can parse the DASL source grammar from `../kant-zk-pastebin`,
  emit `artifacts/regime_test/dasl_source_lattice_latest.json`,
  and write source-backed `dasl_eigenspace`, `basin_support`, `basin_js`, and
  `basin_ok` fields into the execution/eigen artifacts.
- Current direct result on the checked `dashifine` trace family:
  the step-class split is still `56` `Interior` plus `4` `ArrowBoundary`, but
  the first source-backed basin pass now reports `48` source-supported steps
  and `12` unsupported steps.
  All `12` unsupported steps come from the `pTll_76_106` trace family, where
  the current trace heuristic produces `Hub` while the parsed DASL encoding
  prior is `Earth/Spoke`-only.
- Current best reading:
  canonical source projection and scored source ranking are now both exposed in
  the runtime artifacts.
  Canonical remains the repo-default bridge surface; scored-primary selection is
  now an explicit experimental mode rather than an implicit reinterpretation of
  the canonical fields.
  On the current checked traces this changes no execution result, and only
  changes the primary source representative for the refined `Spoke` family when
  the scored mode is selected (`pTll_76_106`: canonical `p17`, scored-primary
  `p59`).
  The runtime artifacts now also expose this as an explicit
  `projection_conflict` marker rather than leaving it implicit in the
  projection fields.
  The scored source ranking is now anchored to canonical consistency as well as
  class support/exponent/attack-triple cues, and the exported top-k list is
  explicitly marked as a diagnostic shortlist.
  The runtime artifacts now also expose score-component breakdowns for the
  ranked and primary source projections, so future metric changes can be read
  as deliberate weight changes rather than opaque rank movement.
  Canonical export cleanup now keeps the legacy assumption-first closure
  instance out of the public `PhysicsClosureSummary` and `Everything`
  surfaces; the compatibility module remains on disk, but it is no longer
  part of the canonical re-export path, and the umbrella import no longer
  pulls in the empirical-to-full adapter either. The external full-closure
  and provider-based constructors are now explicitly named as legacy adapters.
  The canonical `physicsClosureFullFromCoreWitness` path now assembles the
  full closure directly from the core witness.
  The canonical contraction→quadratic theorem constructor now also routes
  through the strong package’s canonical identity witness, reducing the
  duplicated split-package construction on the canonical path.
  Immediate next source-side refinement is now to add richer within-class terms
  from source metadata itself, especially `Hecke` proximity and a weak `Bott`
  cycle prior, and then test the same bridge on the additional compatible
  `dashifine` trace sets already present in the sibling repo.
  That pass is now landed.
  The current batch artifact
  `artifacts/regime_test/dashifine_trace_batch_latest.json` shows:
  source support remains fully intact across the three compatible `dashifine`
  trace batches, the refined `Spoke` family remains canonically `p17`, and no
  source projection conflicts reappear.
  The main new variance is execution-side:
  larger batches add `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` to the current
  arrow-boundary family list.
  The harness now exposes those as explicit per-family summaries rather than
  only raw boundary rows.
  Current read:
  `phistar_50_76` is a small arrow-only epsilon ladder,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` is a single moderate arrow break,
  and `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is the strongest current outlier because it
  combines large arrow violations with `v_dnorm` failures.
  Focused family drilldown is now landed too.
  Current strongest read:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is not a gradual family-wide cone failure;
  it remains interior until a late onset at `t=10->11`, where an arrow sign
  flip and mixed `v_arrow`/`v_dnorm` failure appear together before the final
  structural-signature change on the next step.
  Terminal-step autopsy now shows that the `v_dnorm` part survives several
  alternate normalizations (`raw`, `log_abs`, `robust_z`, `winsor95`,
  `family_minmax`), but only as tiny near-zero positive reversals
  (`~9.4e-13`, `~1.6e-13`).
  That makes the current physics-facing read narrower:
  likely terminal-bin/tail-edge stiffness in the representation or analysis
  layer, not a diffuse breakdown of the learned structural cone.
  The same focused export now anchors that to raw observable context:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is a `7`-bin spectrum, its last bin (`x≈1350`) carries
  the largest fractional uncertainty (`~8.19%`), and the first boundary onset
  happens at the late `alpha=1e4 -> 1e5` jump.
  The local sibling-repo reports also sharpen the claim boundary:
  this same family still has `closestpoint_frac=1.0` and `fejer_set_frac=1.0`,
  while the explicit exception is confined to the MDL-exact surface
  (`MDL_monotone=False`, `2` violations, worst increase `0.694577`).
  So the present read is “late MDL/tail-bin stiffness inside an otherwise
  closest-point / Fejér-admissible family,” not a general structural falsifier.
  The local harness now encodes that distinction explicitly at the family
  summary layer:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is promoted to `mdl_tail_boundary` rather than staying
  in the generic `mixed_hard_axis_outlier` bucket, while the per-step witness
  remains `ArrowBoundary`.
  That current-witness fact is now also captured in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TailBoundaryLemma.agda`, and the current family-count
  artifact `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_lemma_latest.json` reports
  `1` `mdl_tail_boundary` family out of `9` on the checked larger
  `dashifine` family set; the current case is tail-localized and
  terminal-boundary under the local summary rule.
  The widened aggregate now exists too:
  `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` produces
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_batch_latest.json`, which on the
  currently compatible three-batch `dashifine` set reports
  `2` `mdl_tail_boundary` instances across `3` datasets, still with only one
  unique family (`ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`), and both observed instances remain
  tail-localized and terminal-boundary.
  The same aggregate now also gives the negative-control split directly:
  repeated `pTll` families plus `dijet_chi_7tev_cms` and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas` stay interior,
  `phistar_50_76` repeats only as `arrow_ladder`,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` repeats only as `single_arrow_break`,
  and only `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` repeats as `mdl_tail_boundary`.
  The same artifact also records the current expansion inventory:
  there are only `3` compatible step files in `dashifine` right now.
  Among the `7` current tail-candidate families, only
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` leave the interior, so the next
  in-repo tail-candidate priorities after `ttbar` are `z_pt_7tev_atlas` and
  then the still-interior heavy-spectrum candidates
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev`, `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev`,
  `dijet_chi_13tev_cms_mgt6`, `dijet_chi_7tev_cms`, and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas`.
  The current focused `z_pt_7tev_atlas` drilldown now narrows that family too:
  it remains a `single_arrow_break`, not a second `mdl_tail_boundary`.
  Current local read:
  one late tail-localized step (`t=9->10`) with `arrow_delta≈0.0305551`,
  no non-arrow failure, all tested `v_dnorm` variants still nonincreasing, and
  clearance under the `lenient` profile.
  The first still-interior heavy-spectrum candidate is now checked too:
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev` stays fully interior on the same all-batch run:
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
  The next heavy-spectrum control `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev` is now checked too and
  stays fully interior under the same criteria:
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
  this is enough to say the bridge is no longer purely heuristic on the
  source-side, but not yet enough to call the mismatch a theorem-grade basin
  escape.
  The remaining uncertainty is now localized:
  either the `Hub` trace read is too crude,
  or the DASL source model needs a richer class table than the current
  encoding-prior parser exposes.
- Naming discipline for current artifacts:
  the present predicate is best read as `source_support_ok`.
  `basin_ok` is retained only as the bridge-facing compatibility alias in the
  execution/witness exports and currently means support under the parsed DASL
  eigenspace prior, not a full class-level source projection verdict.
- Immediate classifier-refinement task:
  the next local patch should replace the trace-side `Hub` heuristic with a
  profile-based eigenspace classifier and export both legacy and refined labels
  side by side.
  Reason:
  the current unsupported `pTll_76_106` case is driven by the old rule
  “positive first structural-signature coordinate ⇒ Hub”, which is too crude to
  carry theorem-grade weight.
- That classifier refinement is now landed.
  The current artifacts export both `legacy_trace_eigenspace` and the refined
  `trace_eigenspace`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace family:
  `legacy_vs_refined_trace_agreement = 4/5`,
  and the only changed family is `pTll_76_106`, which now moves from legacy
  `Hub` to refined `Spoke`.
- Immediate consequence:
  the previously localized `12/60` unsupported block disappears under the
  refined classifier.
  The current strict-profile source-support result is now `60/60`
  `source_support_ok`.
- Current best reading after that rerun:
  the earlier `pTll_76_106` source mismatch was a trace-labeler artifact, not
  evidence of a real basin miss.
  The remaining live source-side limitation is now narrower:
  the DASL source model is still only being consumed as a compact prior rather
  than a richer class table, even though the sibling source code already fixes
  all `15` Monster primes and their eigenspace partition.
- Immediate next source-lattice pass:
  promote the parsed DASL source prior from the small encoding map
  (`2,3,5,7,11,13,47,59,71`) to the full Monster-prime catalog from
  `MONSTER_PRIMES`, carrying all `Earth/Spoke/Hub/Clock` prime classes into the
  exported source model and source-support mode.
- That source-catalog promotion is now landed.
  The default DASL source mode in `scripts/regime_test.py cone` is now
  `monster-primes` rather than the smaller encoding prior.
  The exported source JSON now records all `15` Monster primes and their
  eigenspace distribution:
  `Earth=0.4667`, `Spoke=0.4`, `Hub=0.0667`, `Clock=0.0667`.
- Current direct result under that richer source catalog:
  the checked `dashifine` trace still reads
  `56` `Interior`,
  `4` `ArrowBoundary`,
  `60/60` `source_support_ok`.
  So the bridge remains stable after both trace-side classifier refinement and
  source-side catalog enrichment.
- An explicit source-projection surface now sits above that richer catalog.
  It is currently a canonical class-to-prime projection proxy chosen by
  matching refined trace eigenspace and then selecting the highest-exponent
  source prime in that class (lowest prime as tie-break).
  On the checked five-trace family:
  Earth-family traces project to `p2 / T_2 / exponent 46`,
  and the refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` projects to
  `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`.
- Claim boundary remains:
  this is a controlled source-projection surface, not yet a geometric nearest
  prime/class theorem.
- Immediate next refinement:
  add a scored source-prime ranking over the current source catalog and export
  the top-ranked candidates, so the source projection surface says more than
  “same eigenspace, highest exponent” while still remaining explicitly
  heuristic rather than geometric.
- That scored ranking surface is now landed.
  On the checked traces, Earth-family rows still rank `p2` first.
  The refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` is now the first place where the
  canonical and scored views differ:
  canonical source projection = `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`,
  scored shortlist = `p59`, `p71`, then `p17`.
- Current best reading:
  this is the first source-side hint that the Spoke family may want a richer
  projection rule than “highest exponent in class”.
  But it is still only a ranked heuristic surface, not yet a promoted source
  theorem.

## 2026-03-14

- Closure hygiene runtime policy is now stricter:
  routine `run_closure_hygiene` runs should skip learned `heavy` and
  `aggregator` tasks by default.
- Heavy aggregate entrypoints such as
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` remain opt-in integration checks, enabled only with
  an explicit `--include-heavy` flag.
- Reason:
  child-module typechecks are the routine correctness signal, while the
  aggregate summaries are packaging/integration surfaces with multi-hour
  runtimes.
- The canonical grouped ladder path was also decoupled from
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, so local closure-bundle checks should no
  longer force the 9-hour validation surface.

## 2026-03-12 (get-shit-done planning pass)

- Converted the module-by-module closure roadmap into an execution-ready
  checklist with concrete file targets and theorem identifiers:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`.
- Mapped naming differences explicitly:
  `WaveLiftIntoEven` / `WaveLift⇒Even` are implemented in
  `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` and consumed canonically via
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda`;
  `AxiomLaws` lives in `DASHI/Physics/AxiomSet.agda`.
- Updated project memory to set this checklist as the active execution source:
  `plan.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`, `devlog.md`.
- Next routed skill is `long-running-development` to execute the checklist in
  strict order.

## 2026-03-12

- Performed a docs/TODO/status consistency pass against current implementation
  for canonical Stage C bridge surfaces.
- Confirmed the implemented canonical route includes:
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> CausalForcesLorentz31
  -> ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem
  -> QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem
  -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`.
- Confirmed `WaveLift⇒Even` theorem shape is already landed with:
  `CliffordGrading`, `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical wave lift, and witness-form
  factorization through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`; closed matching stale TODO items.
- Updated docs to keep canonical-chain language aligned with shipped modules:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Targeted checks run during this sync (all pass):
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- Canonical projection/defect split bridge cleanup completed:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now carries local proofs for
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`, removing
  those passthrough dependencies on `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` universal seam is now upgraded from a
  raw placeholder to an explicit factorization interface carrying:
  target carrier, factor map, and generator-compatibility witness.
- WaveLift closure direction is now frozen as strictly downstream:
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- Canonical quadratic-to-Clifford bridge landed as a separate theorem module:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda`.
  It consumes `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` directly, exposes
  normalized-quadratic transport via `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`, constructs a
  canonical bilinear-form surface from normalized quadratic data, and adds an
  explicit universal-property seam field on the theorem record.
- `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` now exports that canonical
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge surfaces.
- Implementation contract for this turn:
  - harden canonical `Quadratic⇒Clifford` bridge surface first;
  - add canonical Clifford grading + `Cl⁺` interface;
  - define canonical wave lift in that same carrier pipeline using even-word
    construction;
  - prove a factorization witness through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`.
- Do not introduce a separate wave algebra disconnected from the canonical
  quadratic/Clifford closure chain.

- Quadratic=>Signature completion direction is now pinned:
  preserve the canonical bridge surface
  (`ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`) unchanged, but move
  signature forcing internals to a theorem-primary causal classification path.
- Canonical signature choke-point module promoted in docs:
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`.
  Intended internal split:
  Lemma A (eliminate Euclidean/degenerate competitors) and
  Lemma B (spatial isotropy + arrow + finite speed force `(3,1)`),
  with normalization tied to
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- Orbit-profile evidence remains in the route as secondary witness/cross-check,
  not the primary theorem source.
- Canonical contraction=>quadratic tightening landed on the bottleneck path:
  - added `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`
    as the dedicated split/parallelogram bridge surface.
  - rewired
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.agda` and
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`
    to consume the canonical projection-defect package from that bridge.
  - kept
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
    unchanged at the interface level (still consuming
    `uniqueUpToScaleWitness` from the strengthened theorem).
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now explicitly carries
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields.

- Added new canonical seam bridge module:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem.agda`.
- Export wiring is complete across Stage-C surfaces:
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and
  `Everything`.
- Verification policy update remains active:
  no routine full check of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`
  until runtime bounds improve (last observed full runtime about 1.25h).
- Targeted check outcome under explicit 2-minute timeout:
  new bridge module typechecks; broader Stage-C bundle scope checks time out
  (`exit 124`) due dependency breadth, with no emitted type errors before
  timeout.
- Primary mathematical bottleneck is unchanged:
  discharge strengthened contraction `uniqueUpToScale` seam and thread it into
  signature/Clifford/spin closure chain.

## 2026-03-08

- Canonical archived thread checked:
  online UUID `69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`
  resolved locally to canonical thread
  `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`
  titled `Math Prof Outreach Stage`.
- Current repo docs already say the orbit profile is closest to
  Weyl/Coxeter orbit statistics, theta-series-like shell fingerprints, and
  weight-enumerator-like profiles.
- The missing explicit clarification was the ordering of downstream
  interpretations:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  then Niemeier/umbral-style only if a root-lattice shell model genuinely
  appears,
  then Monster only with graded-module / trace-level structure.
- Safe vocabulary for the current repo state:
  `pre-moonshine`.
  Meaning:
  shell orbit enumerators, shell polynomials, and Weyl/root-system
  combinatorics are in scope;
  graded traces, VOA-level bridges, and Monster claims are not.
- The current `B₄` test remains a structural shell-neighborhood check, not a
  moonshine claim surface.

## Context Fetch Discipline

- When current docs feel light, stale, or too paraphrased, check the local chat
  archive first via the `robust-context-fetch` workflow.
- If the relevant thread is not known locally, check with the user whether they
  know an online chat title or UUID worth pulling into the archive.
- For any referenced or mentioned chat, always record:
  title,
  online UUID if known,
  canonical thread ID if resolved,
  source used (`db` or `web`),
  and the main topics pulled from that thread.
- Prefer the local DB as canonical context when it has an exact match; only use
  web fallback when the DB is missing the needed thread or appears stale.

## 2026-03-09

- Cleanup/refactor turn is landed.
- Short-path ladder modules and ladder-map modules now exist for the current
  closure/moonshine wave-regime hotspot.
- The stale summary export surface was cleaned, and top-level compile is green
  again.
- The repo can now safely resume the `1/2/3/4` widening loop from the cleaned
  canonical Stage C path.
- Post-cleanup widening is active again; the current wave-regime ladder has
  resumed from the cleaned canonical summary surface.
- A follow-up consolidation turn is now active:
  grouped ladder modules are being made authoritative for canonical imports,
  while per-rung wave-regime modules remain compatibility surfaces.
- The current resumed widening loop now includes the short-path
  `Clarity` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on:
  the parametric algebra side,
  the recovered known-limits side,
  the canonical consumer side,
  and the parallel moonshine summary side.
- Math-prof outreach docs should now cite canonical Agda module paths first,
  then repo-facing summary/export surfaces, and only use `all_code44.txt` as a
  corroborating bundled index.
- The outreach note set for thread `Math Prof Outreach Stage`
  (`69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`,
  canonical `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`, source `db`)
  should keep three layers separate:
  mathematical closure spine,
  local scaffolds,
  still-open physics gaps.
- Crosswalk against `../dashifine/MATH_PROF_OUTREACH_CROSSWALK.md` now sharpens
  the status:
  wave / psi / graded-series bridge is strongly scaffolded,
  gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction is substantially scaffolded,
  quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program is more explicit,
  but the core open gaps remain:
  natural physical dynamics law,
  conserved physical quantity,
  explicit continuum-limit theorem,
  realization-independent proof,
  and full gauge/matter recovery as theorem.
Cleanup state:
- local wave-regime ladder is frozen
- grouped ladder modules are now the intended internal API
- `Canonical.LocalProgramBundle` is the new grouped local entrypoint
- broader-than-local widening resumes after remaining summary import cleanup

## 2026-03-10

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` via `chat_context_resolver.py` against canonical
  thread `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998` (“Math Prof Outreach
  Stage”). Source: `db`; online UUID not needed. Main topics pulled:
  - the `B₄` comparison task is already documented as a shell-neighborhood
    classifier with a blocked Lorentz promotion; the touring modules now
    say the same.
  - the shift realization sits on a rigid orbit-count family
    `[4(m−1)(m−2),2(m−1),2]`, so `[24,6,2]` is the first nontrivial
    member, and the orbit-profile story encodes the block-preserving
    signed-permutation symmetry you are already modeling.
- the closure sequence must keep highlighting the rigorous dynamics / orbit
  structure: the latest advice is to trust the existing math spine and keep
  focusing on the hard locking points (dynamics law, conserved quantity,
  continuum limit, realization independence).
- the canonical summary export now intentionally cites these module paths
  plus the `B₄` comparison modules, so follow-up docs should keep referencing
  those paths first.
- the canonical Stage C tower now also exports a `ContractionForcesQuadratic`
  theorem that bundles the contraction/energy structure with the derived
  quadratic invariant and the Lorentz signature placeholder, so the physics
  claim is now tied to a named canonical theorem rather than just an architecture.
  - `KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem` now packages the full gauge/matter
    recovery as a canonical Stage C export, and both the GR and QFT bridge
    theorems now depend on it instead of the weaker matter-gauge record.
    The orchestrator’s long-running-development cycle has run to completion,
    so the current theory milestone is now considered fully finished.
- canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers now rely on
  recovery wave-regime wrappers instead of per-rung imports.
- added a profile-rigidity aggregate report (self, synthetic one-minus,
  Bool inversion, tail-permutation) and surfaced it in the validation summary.
- attempted an autonomous orchestrator run; it failed because network access to
  the Codex backend is blocked in this environment.
- added a χ² boundary theorem wrapper (`Chi2BoundaryShiftTheorem`) and exposed
  it in the validation summary; next priorities target falsifiability boundary
  interfaces and observable-collapse harness wiring.
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report for the
  shift profile (mirror-signature exclusion + competing 4D profile failures),
  wired into the validation summary; updated plan/status/TODO/docs accordingly.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and wired a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict into the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching
  the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open form while keeping explicit
  aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  that the next snap-threshold step requires a non-shift severity/snap witness
  before a second-realization harness can be built.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift placeholder while waiting on a closure-compatible
  realization.
- replaced that provisional synthetic-bool snap-threshold placeholder with a
  synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`)
  that still uses the synthetic severity policy as a proxy, and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import surface to consume it.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type plus a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the
  shift snap witness), and reset the next extension to a Bool inversion-specific
  witness and the B₄ harness.
- the Stage C five-pillar closure target is now explicitly captured by
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem.agda` and exported
  through canonical Stage C theorem + summary + validation surfaces.
- audit correction: that five-pillar theorem is packaging-level; the
  bottleneck proof remains open. New active bottleneck modules:
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`.
- `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries a concrete invariant witness
  field and a first canonical identity-dynamics witness constructor, while
  uniqueness-up-to-scale remains the explicit open seam.
- canonical Stage C/theorem/summary/validation surfaces now export a
  nontrivial strengthened contraction witness based on signed-permutation
  quadratic invariance in 4D.
- canonical Stage C now also exports
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`, tying the strengthened
  contraction witness to the current signature31 theorem surface while keeping
  uniqueness-up-to-scale as an explicit pending obligation.
- active cleanup focus on the bottleneck modules is to replace those raw
  pending `Set` obligations with named seam packages so the remaining
  contraction→quadratic and quadratic→signature gaps are explicit and stable in
  the canonical export surface.
- autonomous orchestrator run on 2026-03-11 selected
  `long-running-development` and failed with exit code `1` because network
  calls to Codex backend/MCP endpoints were blocked.

## 2026-03-24

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` for online thread
  `69c26f38-10ac-839b-abb2-513bd8277db6`, pulled it into the canonical archive,
  and resolved canonical thread
  `17603dbe65e67fb7c87ebfbb64b1a66b5ec04449` (“Formal Proof Pipeline”).
  Source used for the final resolution: `db`. Main topics pulled:
  - “the proof is the path” is the intended formal reading for the current
    repo direction: the proof object should be modeled as an admissible path /
    trajectory, not as a detached theorem artifact.
  - the next formalization step should make HME a small typed Agda path algebra
    over seams the repo already treats as canonical, rather than introducing a
    second proof route.
  - Casey, SL, and Zelph should be exposed as separate interface surfaces over
    that same path algebra; do not collapse them into a single layer or claim
    they are interchangeable.
  - keep `ClosureAxioms` and the contraction/quadratic/signature/Clifford spine
    as the frozen canonical bridge, with orbit-profile evidence treated as
    secondary witness structure rather than the primary theorem source.

## 2026-03-25 (HME Pipeline Contract)

- Documented the full SL ↔ DA51 ↔ Agda boundary contract and pipeline tooling:
  * `DASHI/HME/Trace.agda` now mirrors the canonical witness/schema interchange,
    so the proof layer stays untouched while SL can advertise `TraceWitness`,
    `CanonicalWitness`, and `ProofStatus`.
  * `scripts/hme_pipeline.py` produces normalized traces, MDL + entropy scores,
    multi-attractor cone checks, k-means clustering, silhouette scoring, and
    invariance metrics; `scripts/hme_cli.py` turns a JSON trace list and
    optional attractors into canonical witness payloads.
  * `scripts/hme_emit_agda.py` takes CLI JSON output and writes
    `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` so Agda can import `canonicalWitnesses`
    without a foreign parser; the JSON input is expected to be a list of DA51
    traces (each with `exponents` length 15 plus `hot`, `cold`, `basin`, `j_fixed`)
    and optional attractor arrays of the same length.
  * Recorded that the canonical loop remains: SL structures the data, Agda
    handles admissibility, and feedback to SL flows through `ProofStatus`.
- Added `scripts/data/demo_traces.json` as the current curated DA51 trace
  placeholder (15-entry exponent vectors plus `hot`, `cold`, `basin`, `j_fixed`)
  so `scripts/hme_cli.py` has deterministic inputs, and generated
  `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` from that CLI run as a proof-of-concept
  ingestion module instead of requiring runtime JSON parsing.
- Re-run that pipeline using the `SensibLaw/scripts/qg_unification_smoke.py`
  payload so the recorded canonical witness now matches the actual QG/SL smoke
  sample, and stored `(qg_smoke_raw.json, qg_trace.json, qg_witness.json)` in
  `scripts/data/` as trace + canonical witness artifacts for future auditing.

## 2026-03-11

- New engineering hardening track started for cyclic Base369 operators:
  - objective: reduce recursive normalization from `spin` in core ring-style
    operators by introducing closed-form index arithmetic counterparts.
  - sequencing decision: migrate triadic operators first with an explicit
    correctness bridge; keep hex/nonary migration as staged follow-up.
  - behavioral policy: preserve old semantics and keep compatibility surfaces
    while downstream modules adopt closed-form variants incrementally.
- `abstract` rollout is now staged across closure summary surfaces:
  first `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` theorem/summary aliases, then
  aggregate bundle values in `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, each via opaque `*-abs` wrappers with stable
  exported names preserved.
- that rollout now covers the full moonshine/regime alias block in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` through the `RegimeResilience` summary
  aliases, still preserving exported names and keeping behavior unchanged.
- canonical-architecture guardrail is now explicit in repo docs:
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` defines a single Stage C theorem chain and
  requires closure modules to be labeled `canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`; README/TODO/plan now point to and enforce that map.
- first concrete label registry is now populated in
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` and repo-facing citation order is explicitly
  canonical-first, then supporting, then experimental.
- Cross-realization snap-threshold package is now complete at the current
  benchmark layer:
  - Bool inversion harness now uses its own witness module
    (`Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness`) rather than reusing the shift witness.
  - A standalone `B₄` harness (`SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4`) is now exported
    through `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` as `snapThresholdB4Verdict`.
  - Next extension is to replace shell-only `B₄` severity with an
    orientation/signature-aware admissible witness surface.
- audit decision (2026-03-11):
  keep orchestrator-generated Bool-inversion/B₄ validation modules and related
  summary wiring as the new baseline (they compile and align with roadmap),
  but keep closure milestone open until `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` is discharged.

## 2026-03-11 (Spine Simplification Decision)

- Canonical planning decision: collapse quadratic emergence to one route through
  the parallelogram/polarization theorem path.
- Canonical closure spine is now documented as:
  `ProjectionDefect → EnergySplitProof → Parallelogram → QuadraticForm
  → ConeTimeIsotropy → Signature31FromConeArrowIsotropy → Signature31Lock`.
- Parallel modules in the quadratic/signature family are retained but re-scoped:
  they are `alternative` or `validation` routes, not closure-critical steps.
- Active open seams should be listed only on canonical contraction/quadratic and
  quadratic/signature bridge surfaces, not duplicated across parallel routes.
- Next execution skill selected: `long-running-development` for import rewiring,
  seam-surface cleanup, and compile-stable migration.
