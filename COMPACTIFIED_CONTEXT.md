- Resolved the live LILA-to-DASHI bridge thread from the archived ChatGPT URL
  `69d30a80-6ed8-839b-a712-c751b517246d`
  with canonical thread ID
  `9f1b35187081584dfd0d43a51f0e7931bde2d6c3`.
  The stable reading is now explicit in the repo:
  LILA is the execution system, DASHI is the formal admissibility lens, and
  the bridge is a trace contract rather than an equality claim.
  The first repo-native surface for that reading now lives in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaDashiBridge.agda`, with the structured note in
  `Docs/LILA_DASHI_Bridge.md`.
  The first operational bridge pack now also includes
  `scripts/delta_cone_lila.py`, `scripts/checkpoint_prime_vectors.py`, and the
  lifting schema `DASHI/Physics/Closure/LilaTraceFamily.agda`.
  The compare path is now one-command via `scripts/run_all.sh`, with the
  quickstart documented in `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.md` and the PlantUML flow
  diagram source in `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml` and the rendered preview in
  `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`.
  The thread's latest concrete advice was to give him the "best foot forward":
  keep the delta-cone analyzer, add a minimal baseline-vs-LILA compare harness,
  and show training-dynamics plots so the result is credible, evaluable, and
  directionally useful without over-engineering the PR.

- Noncanonical closure-control reframing after the latest audits:
  the active gap is no longer "find a stronger theorem on the current obvious
  state pool". It is now a same-carrier source-generation problem on
  `ShiftContractState`.
- That boundary has now moved one rung:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadicFamily.agda` packages the first
  genuine same-carrier family on that seam. The three one-hot states form a
  triadic family with constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported
  prime images. `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTriadicFamily.agda`
  now lands the next rung up: a support-width-two triadic family with the
  coarse head fixed and a rotating active tail coordinate, again with constant
  `π-mdl-max` and pairwise distinct transported prime images.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractAnchoredTrajectoryFamily.agda` now
  converts that second static family into the first live-step trajectory on
  this seam: the first three states stay inside one `π-mdl-max` fibre and
  keep pairwise distinct transported prime images, and the next live step
  exits the fibre by collapsing to the one-hot fixed point.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractDenseTriadicFamily.agda` now pushes the
  explicit cyclic story one rung further again: support width three also
  admits a same-carrier triadic family with constant `π-mdl-max` and pairwise
  distinct transported prime images.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractSupportCascadeTrajectory.agda` now lands
  the first mixed-scale live trajectory on the seam: a dense seed gives one
  same-fibre width-three step, then exits through the anchored and one-hot
  fibres as the live dynamics contracts support width from 3 to 2 to 1.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTriadicFamily.agda` now
  packages the positive explicit cyclic branch itself as one normalized
  width-parameterized surface.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractStateFamily.agda` now adds the matching
  normalized family-spec surface on the live `ShiftContractState` carrier:
  generic same-carrier family, cyclic-3 specialization, and canonical cyclic
  instances at support widths 1, 2, and 3.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractTriadic3CycleInstance.agda` now lands
  the first concrete balanced tail cycle on that same carrier: keep the head
  fixed at `pos`, rotate the tail block `(pos , zer , neg)` cyclically, and
  the resulting three states still stay in one `π-mdl-max` fibre while
  splitting pairwise at the transported prime image.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractBalancedComposedFamily.agda` now folds
  that balanced cycle into the composed-generator lane as well: the same
  three states are recovered from `fullSupport` by varying a cut mask and a
  neg-restore mask, so the balanced witness is no longer only an explicit
  cycle but also a theorem-bearing compositional generator.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractParametricTrajectoryCompositionFamily.agda`
  now packages the successful 3-state prefixes from the live carrier into one
  generator-class surface:
  explicit cyclic, concrete balanced cycle, dense composed, balanced
  composed, and anchored trajectory.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorFourthStepBoundary.agda` now
  adds the first reusable live fourth-step classifier above that surface:
  the anchored trajectory and explicit width-two branches are explicitly
  marked as exiting the `π-mdl-max` fibre at the fourth step, the balanced
  explicit/composed cycles are marked as exiting to the anchored branch, and
  the explicit width-three and dense composed branches are marked as staying
  inside the same `π-mdl-max` fibre for one more live step.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractMixedScaleTrajectoryFamily.agda` now
  packages the mixed-scale branch into one reusable generator-class surface:
  the dense support cascade is the canonical “stay then exit” family, while
  the full-support cascade is the canonical “exit immediately, then keep
  descending” family.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractGeneratorTaxonomy.agda` now connects
  those normalized surfaces into one higher-level taxonomy: same-fibre prefix
  classes stay visible as generator classes with explicit fourth-step shape
  labels, while the mixed-scale branch is exposed through its own normalized
  family classes on the same carrier.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractCollapseTime.agda` now turns that
  taxonomy into a coarse collapse-time observable:
  `immediateExit`, `exitToAnchored`, or `staysOneMoreStep`.
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapseBridge.agda` now adds the first honest
  Hecke-side bridge from that observable: each generator class gets a
  representative live state, and the existing
  `illegalCount <= forcedStableCount_orbit` ladder at `p2` is re-exported on
  those representatives. This is intentionally weaker than a full persistence
  dictionary; it is a lower-bound bridge, not a quotient theorem.
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitCollapsePressure.agda` now packages the next
  coarse Hecke-side layer above that bridge: collapse class is turned into a
  three-tier pressure classification together with a representative `p2`
  summary carrying the existing orbit lower bound. And
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` now lands the
  first explicit factorization scaffold: on the current generator classes,
  collapse time factors through that coarse defect-pressure summary. This is
  still not a Hecke-determined defect-profile quotient theorem; it is the
  smallest honest factorization surface above the representative-state bridge.
  `Ontology/Hecke/StaysOneMoreStepRepresentativeComputations.agda` now
  evaluates the current `staysOneMoreStep` branch explicitly: each certified
  stay-class now has a chosen representative state, transported prime image,
  `p2` orbit summary, and inherited low-pressure tier. And
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` now packages the first real
  monotonicity law above that layer: `staysOneMoreStep ≤ exitToAnchored ≤ immediateExit`
  as an ordered pressure theorem on the current coarse pressure classes.
  The next theorem layer is now assumption-guarded rather than only
  aspirational:
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` now also exposes explicit
  success predicates for numeric orbit-pressure bounds, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` now exposes the
  corresponding guarded summary-factorization predicates for a future
  Hecke-determined defect-summary quotient. The immediate-exit side is now
  explicit too in
  `Ontology/Hecke/ImmediateExitRepresentativeComputations.agda`, so both the
  stay and immediate branches have named representative-state `p2`
  computation surfaces. The `exitToAnchored` side is now explicit as well in
  `Ontology/Hecke/ExitToAnchoredRepresentativeComputations.agda`. On the
  current classified prefix branch, the exact `p2` counts are now partly
  normalized:
  all current `immediateExit` and `exitToAnchored` representatives have
  `illegalCountP2 = 15` and `forcedStableCountOrbitP2 = 15`,
  while the current `staysOneMoreStep` representatives split as
  `explicitWidth1 ↦ 2` and
  `explicitWidth3, denseComposed ↦ 15`.
  `Ontology/Hecke/StaysVsImmediateRepresentativeOrder.agda` now turns those
  exact count theorems into the first discharged numeric witness layer on the
  current certified classes: every current stay representative is proved
  `≤` every current immediate-exit representative at `p2`, every current
  `exitToAnchored` representative is proved `≤` every current immediate-exit
  representative at `p2`, and the guarded orbit-pressure predicates from
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitPressureOrder.agda` are concretely discharged on
  those certified sets.
  `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativePersistence.agda` now adds the
  first genuinely collapse-free numeric quotient on that same certified
  representative set: the exact Hecke-side `forcedStableCountOrbitP2` count
  determines a small persistence tier, with `explicitWidth1` landing in the
  reduced tier and all current anchored/immediate plus the other current stay
  representatives landing in the saturated tier. The current factorization
  module is now wired to record that exact representative-level quotient:
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectProfileCollapseFactorization.agda` exposes a
  certified representative orbit-count factorization through that
  Hecke-determined count band.
  `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedRepresentativeOrbitSummaryPersistence.agda` now
  lifts that same certified quotient one rung further through the full
  Hecke-side `DefectOrbitSummary` itself: on the current certified set, the
  persistence tier factors through the summary's `forcedStableCount` field,
  not only through the separately named extracted count surface.
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectPersistenceRefinement.agda` now adds the next honest
  refinement above collapse time on that same certified set:
  collapse time alone does not determine the Hecke-side pressure count, but
  collapse time plus one Hecke-derived persistence bit does. Concretely,
  `explicitWidth1` is now isolated as `lowStay`, while
  `explicitWidth3` and `denseComposed` are `highStay`, and all current
  anchored/immediate certified representatives remain `nonStay`. That
  refinement is theorem-bearing through the full `DefectOrbitSummary` via the
  already-landed persistence-tier factorization, so the current certified
  law is now:
  exact `p2` orbit pressure = function of `(collapseTime, stayRefinement)`.
  `Ontology/Hecke/SupportCascadePersistence.agda` now pushes that story one
  step beyond the original certified finite quotient: the mixed-scale
  `supportCascade` class also lands in `staysOneMoreStep`, and its exact
  `p2` orbit-summary `forcedStableCount` is already `15`, so the saturated
  persistence side extends at least to that additional live mixed-scale stay
  class. On the opposite seam,
  `Ontology/Hecke/CertifiedSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` now packages
  the matching negative fact: every current saturated certified
  representative already has `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the present
  orbit-summary factorization through that field cannot split the saturated
  side any further.
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentGeneratorPersistenceRefinement.agda` now lifts the
  positive side of that law to the full current generator taxonomy:
  every currently landed generator class now has an explicit refinement and
  exact current `p2` orbit-pressure value, with `supportCascade` joining the
  saturated-stay branch. And
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedForcedStableCollapse.agda` lifts the
  matching negative theorem to the same scope:
  every currently saturated generator class
  (`explicitWidth3`, `denseComposed`, `balancedCycle`,
  `balancedComposed`, `explicitWidth2`, `anchoredTrajectory`,
  `supportCascade`, `fullSupportCascade`)
  already has summary-field `forcedStableCount = 15`, so the current
  `forcedStableCount`-based summary cannot distinguish any of them.
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedOrbitSummaryCollapse.agda` now strengthens
  that negative boundary again: on the full current saturated generator set,
  the whole current `DefectOrbitSummary` at `p2` already collapses to the
  same fully stable summary
  `(forcedStableCount = 15, motifChangeCount = 0, totalDrift = 0,
    repatterningCount = 0, contractiveCount = 0, expansiveCount = 0)`.
  So the next Hecke-side splitter cannot be "the current orbit summary, but
  looked at more carefully". It must be a richer summary/package than the
  currently landed `DefectOrbitSummary`, or a genuinely new generator class
  outside the current taxonomy. The current best reading is that `3` is the
  generative radix of the recursive ternary construction, while `15` is only
  an emergent saturated `p2` summary value on the fibre side. A structural
  decomposition such as `15 = 9 + 6` is now a plausible next hypothesis, but
  not a landed theorem. A factorization such as `15 = 3 × 5` is now at least
  as plausible on the current recursive ternary reading: `3` as triadic
  sector count, `5` as symmetry-reduced local class count. Three
  implementation surfaces now exist for that next step:
  `Ontology/Hecke/DefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda` packages the smallest
  histogram-style refinement above the current orbit summary,
  `Ontology/Hecke/ForcedStableCountDecomposition.agda` packages a candidate
  additive `9 + 6` decomposition together with a multiplicative `3 × 5`
  factorization on the current saturated branch, and
  `Ontology/Hecke/TriadIndexedDefectOrbitSummaryRefinement.agda` packages the
  next candidate refinement one notch above the flat histogram as a
  triad-indexed `3 × 5` surface. The next fixed-domain target is now also
  explicit in
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedTriadHistogramSeparation.agda`:
  keep the domain frozen to the current saturated generator taxonomy and ask
  whether the triad-indexed histogram separates any of those classes at all.
  The same fixed domain is now packaged one step more concretely in
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedSectorHistogramComputations.agda`:
  the current saturated classes now carry named three-sector histogram
  packages and the next theorem targets are phrased directly on those
  packaged computations rather than only as abstract existential separator
  surfaces. The current status split is now also packaged explicitly in
  `Ontology/Hecke/SaturatedInvariantRefinementStatus.agda`:
  Layer 1 is closed on the current taxonomy
  (`generator -> collapse class -> stay refinement -> exact p2 pressure`),
  while Layer 2 remains open and fixed-domain
  (`current saturated branch -> next separating invariant`).
  That is now the clean repo-wide status line as well:
  progress is substantial but not total. The current coarse
  classification-and-measurement problem is solved on the present generator
  universe, and the only live mathematical bottleneck is the next invariant
  `I₂` that would split the saturated branch. Until that invariant is
  discharged, the repo should be treated as "Layer 1 closed / Layer 2 open"
  rather than as a completed whole-system theory.
  The next proof order is now fixed more tightly as well:
  stay on the current saturated generator set, compare ordered triad-indexed
  sector histograms sector-by-sector before any whole-package comparison, and
  try the most asymmetric current pairs first. The initial predicted pair
  targets are now
  `balancedCycle` vs `supportCascade`,
  `balancedComposed` vs `supportCascade`, and
  `denseComposed` vs `fullSupportCascade`, all packaged directly in
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`.
  The next fallback is now encoded too:
  if those triad-histogram comparisons collapse, the next smallest fixed-domain
  refinement is sector-correlation rather than another count total. That lane
  is now packaged in
  `Ontology/Hecke/TriadSectorCorrelationRefinement.agda`, and the same three
  predicted pairs now carry correlation comparison targets in
  `Ontology/Hecke/CurrentSaturatedPredictedPairComparisons.agda`.
  The next helper surface is now also landed in
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearch.agda`:
  a thin packaging of the current Layer 2 speedrun as
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  on the fixed three-pair order. This does not add a new invariant. It keeps
  the open seam in a bounded proposal/search shape, closer to the sibling
  `../agda` proposal/replay/promote pattern, without reopening the whole
  taxonomy or reclassifying the problem.
  The repo now also carries the truly compile-thin shell
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`,
  which postulates those same targets instead of importing the heavy
  histogram chain. That shell is the safe interactive check for the Layer 2
  control order itself; the heavier `Layer2FiniteSearch.agda` remains only a
  logical thin wrapper and is still transitively expensive.
  The control plane is now executable too:
  `scripts/generate_layer2_long_compute_queue.py`
  emits the current Layer 2 queue in two explicit batches:
  a compile-thin shell batch centered on
  `Ontology/Hecke/Layer2FiniteSearchShell.agda`,
  and a separate offline-heavy replay batch for the three predicted pairs
  in
  `sector -> package -> correlation`
  order, again with optional `agda --parallel` command templates.
  It can now also materialize those batches as files:
  `shell.{txt,json}`,
  `offline-heavy.{txt,json}`,
  plus grouped offline-heavy artifacts by pair and by stage for easier
  offline handoff.
  The artifact directory is now self-indexing too:
  `index.{txt,json}` summarizes the shell batch, the full offline-heavy
  batch, and the grouped pair/stage sub-artifacts from one place.
  The next control-plane helper is now also landed:
  `scripts/render_layer2_batch_commands.py`,
  which consumes one emitted batch JSON artifact and turns it into either
  plain command lines or a runnable bash script.
  It also supports a small dedup mode, so repeated identical `agda`
  invocations can collapse to a unique offline command list when that is the
  more useful handoff artifact.
  The repo now also carries
  `scripts/route_agda_by_layer.py`,
  which turns that same operational lesson into a simple `L0/L1/L2` policy:
  interactive thin targets, bounded medium targets, and queue-only current
  Layer 2 Hecke long-compute targets.
  That script is intentionally queue-only: it externalizes the bounded
  shell-first / replay-later order without touching the heavy proof modules.
  Those modules should currently be treated as long-compute items rather than
  interactive validation targets: they exist as implementation surfaces, but
  their Agda checks should not be re-run in-session until they are moved onto
  the long-compute lane.
  Archived context was also re-resolved from the canonical local archive on
  2026-04-03:
  title `Dashi and Physics Insights`,
  online UUID `69ca43a9-09fc-839b-8cc3-e5ce3868eef5`,
  canonical thread ID `ad17536d8eeb320106585654a0950424abafa93b`,
  source `db`.
  The main recovered decision from that thread was the earlier
  `Forced-Stable Transfer Bridge` priority
  (`illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist <= forcedStableCount_orbit`)
  as the best bridge-closing move at that stage.
  The repo has now advanced beyond that exact boundary: the current open seam
  is not "which bridge theorem first?" but the tighter Layer 2 question of
  whether the fixed-domain triad-indexed refinement splits the saturated
  branch.
  On the physics-side execution lane, the repo boundary is now also sharper:
  the abstract execution contract was already present in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContract.agda`, but the live repo reading is
  now recorded more explicitly as:
  arrow monotonicity, projected-delta cone compatibility, MDL non-increase,
  basin preservation, and eigen-overlap preservation.
  This is a delta-step contract, not a global `Q(x)` descent claim and not a
  `j-fixed(source) => j-fixed(trace)` claim.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionContractLaws.agda` now adds the readable
  receipt/law layer above that contract, and `scripts/execution_contract.py`
  now adds the matching Python projected-delta enforcement surface for
  `closure_embedding_per_step.csv`-style traces.
  The closure-side projection/basin seam is now explicit too:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Projection.agda` carries the projection carrier,
  source/state delta carriers, and projected-delta compatibility;
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/Basin.agda` carries the attractor-relative basin
  object on the projected carrier; and `ExecutionContract.agda` now consumes
  those objects directly rather than leaving projection and basin only as
  free predicates.
  The runtime mirror of that move is
  `scripts/run_execution_contract_on_closure_csv.py`, which wires the
  reusable projected-delta enforcer onto `closure_embedding_per_step.csv`
  inputs directly.
  That wiring is no longer isolated either:
  `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` now runs the same closure-CSV execution
  contract for each compatible batch and records per-dataset receipt summaries
  alongside the existing tail-boundary family aggregation.
  The older `scripts/regime_test.py` harness no longer treats the legacy
  ultrametric signature screen as the execution acceptance boundary either:
  `structural_ok` is retained as a diagnostic field, but `joint_ok` and
  `status_class` now track the actual execution contract surface
  `(cone ∧ mdl ∧ basin ∧ eigen) ∧ arrow`.
  The last prefix-side hole is now closed: `explicitWidth1` is no longer
  `boundaryUnknown`, because the one-hot third state steps to another one-hot
  state while staying in the same `π-mdl-max` fibre for one more live step.
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractComposedFamily.agda` now adds the first
  genuinely compositional generator on that same carrier: a ternary
  interaction rule combining a shared base state, a varying cut mask, and a
  shared restore mask. On the current seam that rule recovers the dense
  width-three cyclic branch exactly, so the generator search has now crossed
  from “families of hand-written states” to “ways to build states from other
  states”. And
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ShiftContractFullSupportTrajectory.agda` now adds a
  distinct full-support seed whose live trajectory cascades 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.
- What has been explicitly eliminated on that seam:
  - the old coarse obstruction pair no longer survives on `mdlLevel × π-max`;
  - the bounded same-carrier witness wrappers have not produced a fresh
    equal-`π-mdl-max` / unequal-prime-image pair;
  - the direct explicit-state pool is no longer globally exhausted:
    the one-hot states fail as pairwise probes but succeed as a triadic
    family, the anchored support-width-two triad now succeeds as well, and the
    dense support-width-three triad now succeeds as well;
    direct neg/pos tail patterns remain checked without a fresh witness on
    this seam, and `ShiftContractTailPatternTrajectoryObstruction.agda` now
    shows they also leave the `π-mdl-max` fibre immediately under the live
    shift step;
  - the immediate representation-level fallback
    `eigenShadow × π-max` is now blocked at the canonical `p2` seam by a
    direct no-go control schema.
- Consequence:
  the remaining candidates are no longer local perturbations, obvious witness
  recombinations, or nearby representation-layer lifts. The next honest search
  surface is a structured family generator on the same carrier:
  parameterized families, trajectory-generated families, or mixed-scale
  families whose `π-mdl-max` image is constant while transported prime image
  varies.
- Derived search constraints after those eliminations:
  - any viable family must remain inside one `π-mdl-max` fibre;
  - its varying directions must lie in
    `ker(π-mdl-max) \ ker(primeImage)`;
  - it should avoid pure pair-generated or involutive constructions;
  - direct tail-only probes remain weak on this seam, but one-hot states are
    no longer excluded once they are used triadically rather than pairwise;
  - the smallest plausible nontrivial source is now demonstrably a triadic or cyclic
    family, not because 3 states are logically required, but because the
    current seam is already killing pairwise/reflection-level differences.
- Immediate docs/TODO guidance:
  stop describing the next step as "try another widening". The first same-
  carrier triadic families are now landed, and the first live-step trajectory
  family is landed too, and the first mixed-scale trajectory is landed as
  well. The next step is to go beyond the current explicit cyclic/trajectory
  families, which now span support widths 1, 2, and 3 plus one mixed-scale
  cascade and one full-support cascade, and add new `ShiftContractState`
  families to test against the existing `π-mdl-max` / prime-image seam.

- Current closure-language correction:
  "closure" must mean more than a compiling bridge or a toy that works on one
  carrier. The durable target is now stated as:
  one carrier,
  one admissible law,
  one observable algebra,
  one RG/coarse-graining story,
  and one conserved/defect interpretation,
  with no unresolved bridge theorem between those layers.
- Current canonical repo status relative to that target:
  - the first honest canonical closure→schedule bridge is now landed only on
    the quotient `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`;
  - the larger projected package
    `Gauge × basinLabel × mdlLevel × motifClass × eigenShadow`
    is still obstructed on the `CP` branch as a closure→schedule bridge even
    though it remains the strongest landed closure-honest conserved package on
    the canonical AGMB carrier;
  - raw `heckeSignature` and raw `eigenSummary` remain explicitly obstructed
    on `CP`.
- Main interpretation decision pulled from the current local theorem state:
  the present closure law is already acting like a physical quotient.
  The right next question is therefore not "how do we force every fine channel
  to survive?" but "what is the maximal closure-invariant observable package,
  and how should the non-descending channels be reinterpreted as
  gauge/fibre/defect structure?"
- Immediate implementation-facing target:
  define that maximal closure-invariant observable package explicitly, prove
  the current canonical inhabitant for the motif-level bridge package, and
  classify the failed channels
  (`mdlLevel`, `eigenShadow` as bridge data, raw `eigenSummary`,
  raw `heckeSignature`) as obstruction/defect data rather than silent failures.
- Newly landed canonical fibre step:
  `CanonicalClosureFibre.agda` now defines the thin fibre over the coarse
  quotient `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, and
  `CanonicalClosureFibreFields.agda` lifts the obstructed Hecke/eigen channels
  to fibre-indexed fields. The first control theorem on that surface is
  intentionally modest: forced-stable and illegal counts are now proved
  chamber-invariant for fibre representatives via the existing
  `FactorVecChamberDefectHistograms` machinery.
- Immediate next gap after that landing:
  strengthen the fibre-field story from count control to factorization through
  richer defect-profile or histogram carriers on each coarse closure fibre.
- Newly landed richer fibre step:
  `CanonicalClosureFibreDefectFactorization.agda` now places the canonical
  fibre fields on explicit defect-profile, histogram, and orbit-summary
  carriers. The current theorem strength is still honest rather than inflated:
  illegal chamber entries force stable/zero-drift profile behaviour, and the
  fibre-side forced-stable count is bounded above by the orbit-summary stable
  count. What remains open is direct control or factorization of the actual
  Hecke/eigen fibre fields through those carriers.
- Stronger obstruction found after that:
  `CanonicalClosureFibreEigenShadowObstruction.agda` shows that `eigenShadow`
  does not descend even to the canonical coarse closure fibre. `CR` and `CP`
  already lie in the same coarse fibre
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`, but their `eigenShadowField` values
  differ. So `eigenShadow` is now firmly on the fibre-data side of the split,
  and the next question is how its variation is controlled by the landed
  defect-profile/orbit-summary carriers.
- First positive answer on that control question:
  `CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda` now proves that the richer
  orbit-summary family already distinguishes that same-fibre `CR`/`CP` pair,
  and the single `p2` orbit-summary coordinate already separates it. So the
  remaining gap is no longer "does the richer carrier see the variation?" but
  "which orbit-summary or defect-profile quotient is the right structural
  control surface for it?"
- New promotions after that:
  `CanonicalClosureCoarseObservable.agda` now turns the current canonical
  boundary into a theorem-bearing module: `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass`
  is formalized as the maximal currently bridged coarse observable package,
  with factorization through the landed schedule-side bridge and
  obstruction-facing wrappers for the wider `CP` failures.
- `CanonicalClosureFibreOrbitSummaryControl.agda` now goes beyond witness-only
  separation: on the canonical coarse fibre, equality of the `p2`
  orbit-summary coordinate forces equality of `eigenShadowField`. So `p2`
  is now a genuine control surface on that carrier, not just a detecting
  coordinate.
- That control surface is now packaged explicitly as a factor-law object in
  the same module via `P2EigenShadowFactorLaw` and the canonical instance
  `canonicalP2EigenShadowFactorLaw`.
- The same `p2` coordinate now also controls `heckeField` on the canonical
  coarse fibre. So the first nontrivial Hecke/eigen fibre controls now share
  the same canonical orbit-summary surface.
- First broader replay after the canonical promotions:
  `ShiftContractObservableTransportPrimeCompatibilityProfileInstance.agda`
  now exercises the observable-transport plus prime-compatibility stack on
  full `ShiftContractState`, recovering the witness-level bridge and the
  `illegalCount-chamber ≤ forcedStableCount-hist` surface on a broader
  noncanonical carrier without changing the current reporter boundary.
- The coarse package itself has now been replayed noncanonically in
  `ShiftContractCoarseObservable.agda`, which packages the projection to
  `Gauge × basinLabel × motifClass` on `ShiftContractState` and factors it
  through the existing observable-transport witness and bundle observable
  surfaces.
- That broader replay now also has a matching fibre surface:
  `ShiftContractCoarseFibre.agda` defines the thin fibre over the same coarse
  package, and `ShiftContractCoarseFibreFields.agda` lifts the first
  noncanonical Hecke/eigen/prime/count/orbit-summary fields onto it. So the
  remaining noncanonical gap is a control theorem, not missing vocabulary.
- That control gap is now sharper on the negative side as well:
  `ShiftContractNoncanonicalP2ControlObstruction.agda` proves the current
  broader coarse package is too weak for a canonical-style `p2` factor law.
  Two explicit `ShiftContractState` values have the same `π-max` image but
  different transported prime images, so the next noncanonical control
  surface has to strengthen the invariant package itself.
- The first candidate-search round above that obstruction is now landed:
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseObservable.agda` and
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibre.agda` now package the cheapest aligned
  strengthening `mdlLevel × π-max` as a reusable normalized surface with its
  own thin fibre. `ShiftContractMdlLevelCoarseFibreFields.agda` now gives
  that surface its matching Hecke/eigen/prime/count/orbit-summary field
  layer, `ShiftContractMdlLevelP2ControlAttempt.agda` packages the first
  narrow positive theorem there, and
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelCounterexampleAudit.agda` records that the original
  coarse counterexample pair is no longer the active blocker on this surface.
  `ShiftContractNoncanonicalMdlP2Control.agda` still packages the missing
  stronger noncanonical `p2` control-shape. `ShiftContractEigenShadowNormalizedPackage.agda` and
  `ShiftContractEigenShadowP2ControlCandidate.agda` package the immediate
  fallback `eigenShadow × π-max`, while
  `ShiftContractRGObservableProjection.agda` keeps the full normalized shift
  RG observable projection as the upper-bound reference surface. So the next
  noncanonical theorem attempt is now to find the new witness or prove the
  first genuine prime-image control theorem on `mdlLevel × π-max`, not another
  package search. The intermediate orbit-summary step is now landed too:
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda` shows that prime
  equality on the mdl-level fibre already forces equality of the `p2`
  orbit-summary coordinate, and
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelP2PrimeBridge.agda` now packages the full
  orbit-summary coordinate corollaries of that bridge. The first singleton
  subfamily theorem is also now landed in
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyAttempt.agda`, while
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelChi2WitnessAudit.agda` records that the chi2 witness
  pool is carrier-mismatched for this seam.

## 2026-03-31

- Archive/formalism sweep is now broad enough to drive the next physics-closure
  phase, though not every Agda-adjacent thread has been exhaustively audited.
- Canonical archived threads checked from the local DB:
  - title `Dashi and Physics Insights`,
    online UUID `69ca43a9-09fc-839b-8cc3-e5ce3868eef5`,
    canonical thread `ad17536d8eeb320106585654a0950424abafa93b`,

  - title `Branch · Visualising Collapse and Sparsity - RTX - light transport`,
    online UUID `69719a75-e538-8320-b5cc-1da13392b090`,
    canonical thread `ea0e0d537a1c6effd17bba4c32faeec4f8fc66f5`,
    source `db`.
- Main archive decisions pulled from those threads:
  - the newly resolved `Dashi and Physics Insights` thread sharpens the Hecke
    boundary:
    Hecke/FRACTRAN belong on the prime-lattice representation layer rather
    than in the transported conserved witness on the contractive dynamics
    layer;
  - the same `Dashi and Physics Insights` thread was refreshed again on
    2026-03-31 and did in fact ingest newer material:
    the thread now resolves to `144` archived messages.
    The latest high-signal target is no longer another raw Hecke lift:
    the highest-probability next bridge shape is a forced-stable transfer
    statement (illegal-count compatibility through the closure→shift transport
    image `S(x)`), with the candidate chain
    `illegalCount_chamber ≤ forcedStableCount_hist ≤ forcedStableCount_orbit`.
    The explicit bridge target is now written as:
    `illegalCount_chamber(x,p) ≤ forcedStableCount_hist(S(x),p) ≤
    forcedStableCount_orbit(S(x),p)`, with equality of the first inequality as
    the preferred next strengthening.
  - the remaining proof mass is still dynamics bound to invariants, not
    discovery of cone/projection/quadratic structure from scratch;
  - projected-delta structure remains the right invariant carrier, and
    cone monotonicity should be treated boundary-vs-interior rather than as a
    flat global predicate;
  - the cone-monotonicity archive also sharpens the mathematical route:
    non-expansiveness alone does not force orthogonality; the honest bridge is
    closer to proximal/closest-point structure or MDL-energy-first quadratic
    recovery;
  - the snap-filtering thread is now promoted from “analysis noise” to a real
    support lane for signature forcing and arrow-separated delta interfaces;
  - the same snap-filtering thread now contributes a concrete interface rule:
    arrow-separated delta cone is the honest screen, and the arrow coordinate
    should orient forwardness while staying outside the quadratic itself;
  - sparse/twist/phase transport remains the strongest missing physical channel
    from the archive side;
  - the light-transport / MASI-style phase-synchronization material is the
    strongest current physical bridge for quotient observables and MDL-style
    representative selection, but it has not yet been formalized locally;
  - the light-transport thread is strong on multi-sensor wavefield recovery
    and phase synchronization, but it is not yet an archived proof of a full
    lensless time-of-flight formalism.
- Current Hecke-side stack status has now been tightened in local docs:
  the repo already has representation, transport, defect, quotient,
  correspondence, and exact chamber layers on the `FactorVec` / Monster-prime
  carrier. The open layers are compressed chamber quotients, orbit families,
  correspondence algebra, weighted/measure layers, spectral structure, and any
  bridge into the contractive physics bundle.
- Current Hecke-side next theorem target:
  extract histogram-level data from the 15-entry defect correspondence fiber
  and prove chamber-stability first for the forced-stable / illegal count
  before attempting stronger full-profile chamber invariants.
- Resolver bug fixed during the same pass:
  `ITIR-suite/chat_context_resolver_lib/live_provider.py` had been ignoring
  `~/.chatgpt_session_new` and therefore falling back to a stale legacy token;
  the live path now checks the refreshed token source first.
- Current archive-backed priority order for the repo:
  - P0:
    derived dynamics law,
    realization-independent projection/delta theorem,
    signature forcing / execution-delta interface,
    continuum scaling law;
  - P1:
    physical reality bridge from wavefield / phase synchronization;
  - P2:
    algebraic-carrier / moonshine-adjacent archive material unless it directly
    helps the physics-closure spine.

## 2026-03-30

- New representation-language clarification:
  the repo did not previously carry a local colour note, so this decision is
  now explicit in `Docs/ColourInDashi.md`.
- Current safe colour-language split:
  - optical colour = projected observable
  - perceptual colour = organized or reconstructed interpretation of that
    observable
  - QCD colour = separate gauge-theoretic internal degree of freedom
- Current safe Dashi claim:
  colour is a projection-stable observable on a structured latent signal.
  MDL can choose preferred representatives of a projection class, but that
  reconstruction rule should not be identified with the observable itself.
- Claim-boundary correction:
  ultrametric similarity and cone-screened delta dynamics are internal Dashi
  geometry/dynamics on encoded colour states; they should not be stated as
  finished empirical theorems about human perceptual colour space.
- New internal-symmetry clarification:
  `Docs/TriadicCarrierToSU3.md` now records the safe bridge from a triadic
  3-sector carrier to an `SU(3)`-like internal symmetry candidate.
  Current decision:
  triadic structure supplies carrier grammar only; Hermitian norm preservation,
  determinant-one admissible mixing, and observable quotienting are the extra
  ingredients required before the `SU(3)` language becomes defensible.
- New MDL toy clarification:
  `Docs/MusicalSymmetryMDL.md` and `scripts/musical_symmetry_mdl.py` now pin
  the stronger symmetry-emergence experiment.
  Current decision:
  the right test is no longer "symmetry rewarded therefore symmetry wins" but
  "compression/MDL proxy plus contraction yields symmetric attractor classes
  with large basins."
- The photonuclear / near-miss bridge is now documented end to end in local
  notes:
  `Docs/PhotonBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CMSPhotonuclearBridge.md`,
  `Docs/CharmPhotoproduction.md`,
  `Docs/SaturationLayer.md`,
  and `Docs/CMSCapstone.md`.
- The current executable target is no longer documentation alone, but a small
  surrogate numerical prototype that tests explanatory structure rather than
  fitted empirical success.
- The prototype surface is split deliberately into three layers:
  Dashi observable extraction
  (`scripts/prototype_schema.py`),
  reduced model families
  (`scripts/prototype_gbw.py`, `scripts/prototype_ipsat.py`),
  and runner/comparison entrypoints
  (`scripts/prototype_runner.py`,
  `scripts/compare_prototype_channels.py`,
  `scripts/compare_surrogate_models.py`).
- Current governance correction:
  the prototype should not assert that near-miss channels are intrinsically
  preferred. It should expose how the surrogate explains different channels in
  terms of defect intensity, MDL burden, promoted observables, and model
  response.
- The example states are no longer meant to remain freehand fixtures. The next
  prototype anchor is a small emitter that materializes those JSON inputs from
  the canonical shift geometry / admissibility path, centered on
  `canonicalShiftStateWitness` and the `ShiftInBasin` coarse-head condition.
- The batch prediction matrix remains the main explanatory inspection surface,
  but it should now be read as operating on emitted shift-path states rather
  than arbitrary hand-authored examples.
- The runner layer now auto-refreshes the canonical emitted example files when
  those documented paths are missing or stale relative to the emitter script.
- The prototype now has a shared non-fitting explanation scorecard based on
  normalized residual, MDL burden, and surrogate-confidence penalty. This is
  the current repo-local meaning of “better explanation”; it is explicitly not
  an empirical fit score.

## 2026-03-27

- Upstream PR `#1` (`nix support`) is now treated as the active source merge
  target for the missing Agda surface in this checkout.
- The specific PR payload to bring in is the new Agda/modules and perf wiring:
  `Kernel/KAlgebra.agda`, `Monster/MUltrametric.agda`,
  `Moonshine.agda`, `MoonshineEarn.agda`, `JFixedPoint.agda`,
  `PerfHistory.agda`, `perf_da51.py`, and the import rewrites that point the
  existing modules at those names.
- The current local tree still has the merge-prep tooling surface, and now has
  the PR `#1` Agda source and generated artifacts that are required by the main
  import graph.
- Confirmed the sibling Lean repo `../dashi_lean4` is present locally at
  `/home/c/Documents/code/dashi_lean4`.
- Current contents are a small Lean-side perf/CBOR bridge rather than a full
  formal mirror:
  `Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `MoonshineEarn.lean`,
  and `DashiPerf/{Schema,Audit,Sample100,Sample101,Sample102}.lean`.
- Use it as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema witness and perf-ingest target,
  not as the missing DASL class/projection layer or as a replacement for the
  AGDA source anchor.
- This does not change the earlier bridge decision:
  `../kant-zk-pastebin` remains the source-side anchor, and `../dashi_lean4`
  remains an auxiliary Lean witness repo.

## 2026-03-25

- Applied `zkp-problem-framing`, `get-shit-done`, and
  `autonomous-orchestrator` to the remaining repo backlog.
- Durable framing result:
  the repo is past setup churn; the active work is the physics-closure spine
  and canonical export cleanup, governed by
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`.
- Added `Docs/AutonomousOrchestratorClosureFrame.md` as the durable
  orchestration/frame note for this phase.
- Normalized `status.json` to the autonomous-orchestrator control vocabulary.
  Current intended route:
  `autonomous-orchestrator` control plane -> `long-running-development`
  child skill.
- Validation guardrail remains unchanged:
  treat `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and full `Everything.agda`
  runs as checkpoint-only because they remain too heavy for routine loops.

## 2026-03-23

- Review of upstream PR `#1` (`nix support`) showed the main technical gap is
  not the presence of the demo JSONL files themselves, but the fact that the
  proposed `flake` coverage only walks top-level `*.agda` plus
  `Verification/`, while the repo and the PR both add meaningful Agda surface
  under `Kernel/` and `Monster/`.
- Merge-prep decision for the local repo:
  keep demo DA51/zkperf JSONL artifacts acceptable in principle for now if
  they are explicitly documented as illustrative witness data rather than
  reproducibility-critical source inputs.
- The actual merge hardening target is therefore:
  add a local `flake`/`agda-lib` surface whose authoritative check mirrors the
  existing GitHub action on `DASHI/Everything.agda`, and add a second
  recursive smoke surface covering the merge-relevant standalone roots plus
  recursive `Kernel/`, `Monster/`, and `Verification/` modules.
- That local merge surface is now concretized by `flake.nix`,
  `dashi-agda.agda-lib`,
  `scripts/list_merge_agda_targets.sh`, and
  `scripts/run_agda_merge_smoke.sh`.
- The same merge-relevant recursive target surface should drive
  `agda-record-all`, so future perf/witness collection does not silently omit
  nested modules while pretending to represent the whole repo.
- Current merge-policy decision:
  do not force JSONL sanitization in this pass;
  instead document those demo artifacts as non-authoritative and keep the real
  technical requirement on recursive check/record coverage.
- Merge-prep closeout:
  the local Nix / zkperf surface is now implemented, locked, validated, and
  pushed; future attention returns to the physics closure and tail-boundary
  priorities already tracked elsewhere in the repo.

## 2026-03-22

- Canonical archived thread checked:
  title `ZKP Anomaly Analysis`,
  online UUID `69bf03e8-7634-839b-a9fd-74ed3616943f`,
  canonical thread `cff5c44711a788e01cdbadd98a72822ce1bb8786`,
  source `db`.
- Main repo-facing wording correction from that thread:
  Monster-labeled proof artifacts should not be described as forming a distinct
  global cluster or unique fingerprint under the current exponent embedding.
- Safe claim boundary for symmetry-adjacent anomaly reports:
  the current embedding may reveal a small low-variance rigid substructure, but
  that structure is not yet unique to Monster-labeled samples and should be
  framed as non-discriminative unless baseline/control comparisons separate it.
- Repo docs/TODOs should therefore keep Monster/Moonshine language downstream
  of a real graded-module / trace bridge and avoid upgrading rigid-slot
  observations into theorem-grade self-reference claims.
- Additional decision from the same thread content:
  the current DA51 / exponent-vector embedding is behaving primarily as a
  representation-level structural encoding, not a semantic discriminator for
  Monster-labeled proofs.
- Interpretation split now made explicit:
  JMD-side questions should use static regime/classification features such as
  `eigenspace`, `bott`, `Hecke`, `orbifold`, `DA51`, and `j-fixed`;
  DASHI-side questions should use dynamic/trace features such as `Δx`,
  cone compatibility, contraction/Fejér behavior, and trajectory admissibility.
- The `p47` / `j-fixed` slot should currently be treated as a baseline gauge
  normalization or structural constraint, not as a Monster-specific signal.
- Next validation order from this thread:
  first a JMD regime-occupancy/divergence test on matched Monster vs control
  modules, then a DASHI delta-regime test on source-vs-trace behavior.
- DASHI-side cone rewrite is now sharper:
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` learns admissible ternary signatures on
  structural axes and treats the arrow axis as a separate monotonicity guard.
- Direct run on
  `../dashifine/hepdata_lyapunov_test_out/dashi_idk_out.csv/closure_embedding_per_step.csv`
  with the `dashifine-closure-embedding` preset now gives:
  `structural_cone_pass_rate=1.0`,
  `arrow_pass_rate=0.9333`,
  `joint_pass_rate=0.9333`.
- Current diagnosis:
  the structural cone is empirically intact on that trace family; the residual
  failures are localized `v_arrow` monotonicity violations on
  `phistar_50_76`, not diffuse geometric breakdown.
- Ultrametric/ternary follow-up is now landed in the same harness:
  those `phistar_50_76` failures keep the same admissible structural ternary
  signature, have zero nearest-signature distance, and show up as arrow-only
  boundary cases with max ultrametric radius under the current bucket scheme.
- Arrow-guard sweep is now landed too.
  On the same `dashifine` trace:
  `eps=1e-4` lifts joint pass to `0.95`,
  `eps=1e-3` lifts it to `0.9667`,
  `eps=1e-2` lifts it to `0.9833`,
  and `eps=1e-1` clears all remaining boundary cases.
- The four current localized `phistar_50_76` boundary steps require minimum
  arrow tolerances of about:
  `3.99867e-05`, `8.11219e-04`, `8.13658e-03`, and `7.97279e-02`.
- Boundary/interior split is now explicit in the local harness:
  the checked `dashifine` trace currently classifies as
  `56` interior steps and `4` `arrow_boundary` steps,
  with no structural-boundary or outside-class cases.
- A canonical arrow-profile layer is now landed in the same harness:
  `strict` keeps `arrow_eps=0`,
  `boundary` uses `arrow_eps=1e-2`,
  and `lenient` uses `arrow_eps=1e-1`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace those profiles yield:
  `strict -> 56 interior / 4 arrow_boundary`,
  `boundary -> 59 interior / 1 arrow_boundary`,
  `lenient -> 60 interior`.
- The cone harness can now also write a stable arrow-boundary artifact to
  `artifacts/regime_test/arrow_boundary_latest.csv`;
  on the current direct `dashifine` run that artifact contains the four
  localized `phistar_50_76` boundary steps.
- The missing JMD-side dataset is now partially landed as a local builder:
  `scripts/build_jmd_regime_table.py` scans the Agda tree and emits
  `artifacts/regime_test/jmd_regime_table.csv`.
- First builder run produced `844` rows total with `7` Monster rows and `6`
  matched control rows.
- That builder is now seeded via `data/regime_test/jmd_regime_seed.csv` and
  no longer emits an all-`<missing>` matched table.
  Current matched occupancy read is:
  `eigenspace JS=0.5569`,
  `bott JS=0.0608`,
  `joint(eigenspace,bott,hecke) JS=0.6176`,
  with the permutation/classification pass now restricted to the actual
  `M/O` comparison rows.
- The execution-admissibility bridge is now implemented too:
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone` can export
  `artifacts/regime_test/execution_admissibility_latest.json`,
  `artifacts/regime_test/eigen_overlap_latest.csv`,
  and a generated Agda witness module
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ExecutionAdmissibilityCurrentTraceWitness.agda`.
- New parallel Agda surface:
  `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` is now a separate witness layer from
  `DynamicalClosureWitness`, threaded through
  `PhysicsClosureCoreWitness` and exposed from
  `MinimalCrediblePhysicsClosure` without breaking the broader closure stack.
  That parallel witness surface now includes both the step-level execution
  witness and the family-level classification witness, so
  `MDLTailBoundaryFamily` is no longer only a Python artifact.
- Current strict-profile execution witness read:
  `56` `Interior`,
  `4` `ArrowBoundary`,
  `0` `StructuralBoundary`,
  `0` `Outside`.
  The current trace-derived eigen overlap remains coverage-limited and
  provisional; on the checked `dashifine` trace it currently operates in
  `trace` mode with no JMD match coverage for those HEPData labels.
- New source-side bridge clarification:
  the explicit DASL / Monster source anchor is now identified in the sibling
  repo `../kant-zk-pastebin`, not in the Agda tree itself.
  In particular:
  `src/dasl.rs` fixes the `0xDA51` address grammar, Monster prime basis, Hecke
  list, attack triple `(47,59,71)`, and orbifold coordinates in
  `Z/71 × Z/59 × Z/47`;
  `src/sheaf.rs` adds `EigenSpace`, encoding-to-prime mapping, Bott/Hecke
  address fields, and DASL section/address packaging;
  `src/ipfs.rs` wraps content in a DASL/CBOR envelope carrying orbifold and
  DASL address metadata.
- Lean-side cross-check:
  the sibling repo `../dashi_lean4` exists locally and still does not close
  the current JMD-side gap. It is useful as a Lean-side DA51/moonshine/schema
  witness (`Main.lean`, `MoonshineFractran.lean`, `DashiPerf/Schema.lean`,
  `DashiPerf/Audit.lean`), but it does not provide the missing class/projection
  layer: no DASL address grammar, no `EigenSpace` / `Earth|Spoke|Hub|Clock`,
  no Bott/Hecke/orbifold class table, and no class-level source projection for
  the HEPData trace families.
- Current bridge reading after that code check:
  `kant-zk-pastebin` supplies the source-side `Σ_src` anchor for
  source/basin/eigen questions,
  while the local `ExecutionAdmissibilityWitness` remains the execution-side
  contract layer.
  This means:
  the next implementation step is not a new structural cone learner, but a
  loader/projection path from `scripts/regime_test.py` into the DASL source
  model so `basin_ok` and `eigen_ok` stop depending only on trace or seeded JMD
  proxies.
- Claim boundary remains strict:
  the sibling repo provides an explicit source lattice grammar and semantic
  address structure, but not a finished class table or a proof that DASHI
  projection preserves the `p47`/gauge slot automatically.
  Any such gauge-compatibility claim remains provisional until the trace is
  actually projected into that lattice and checked.
- That first source-backed trace check is now landed in
  `scripts/regime_test.py cone`.
  The harness can parse the DASL source grammar from `../kant-zk-pastebin`,
  emit `artifacts/regime_test/dasl_source_lattice_latest.json`,
  and write source-backed `dasl_eigenspace`, `basin_support`, `basin_js`, and
  `basin_ok` fields into the execution/eigen artifacts.
- Current direct result on the checked `dashifine` trace family:
  the step-class split is still `56` `Interior` plus `4` `ArrowBoundary`, but
  the first source-backed basin pass now reports `48` source-supported steps
  and `12` unsupported steps.
  All `12` unsupported steps come from the `pTll_76_106` trace family, where
  the current trace heuristic produces `Hub` while the parsed DASL encoding
  prior is `Earth/Spoke`-only.
- Current best reading:
  canonical source projection and scored source ranking are now both exposed in
  the runtime artifacts.
  Canonical remains the repo-default bridge surface; scored-primary selection is
  now an explicit experimental mode rather than an implicit reinterpretation of
  the canonical fields.
  On the current checked traces this changes no execution result, and only
  changes the primary source representative for the refined `Spoke` family when
  the scored mode is selected (`pTll_76_106`: canonical `p17`, scored-primary
  `p59`).
  The runtime artifacts now also expose this as an explicit
  `projection_conflict` marker rather than leaving it implicit in the
  projection fields.
  The scored source ranking is now anchored to canonical consistency as well as
  class support/exponent/attack-triple cues, and the exported top-k list is
  explicitly marked as a diagnostic shortlist.
  The runtime artifacts now also expose score-component breakdowns for the
  ranked and primary source projections, so future metric changes can be read
  as deliberate weight changes rather than opaque rank movement.
  Canonical export cleanup now keeps the legacy assumption-first closure
  instance out of the public `PhysicsClosureSummary` and `Everything`
  surfaces; the compatibility module remains on disk, but it is no longer
  part of the canonical re-export path, and the umbrella import no longer
  pulls in the empirical-to-full adapter either. The external full-closure
  and provider-based constructors are now explicitly named as legacy adapters.
  The canonical `physicsClosureFullFromCoreWitness` path now assembles the
  full closure directly from the core witness.
  The canonical contraction→quadratic theorem constructor now also routes
  through the strong package’s canonical identity witness, reducing the
  duplicated split-package construction on the canonical path.
  Immediate next source-side refinement is now to add richer within-class terms
  from source metadata itself, especially `Hecke` proximity and a weak `Bott`
  cycle prior, and then test the same bridge on the additional compatible
  `dashifine` trace sets already present in the sibling repo.
  That pass is now landed.
  The current batch artifact
  `artifacts/regime_test/dashifine_trace_batch_latest.json` shows:
  source support remains fully intact across the three compatible `dashifine`
  trace batches, the refined `Spoke` family remains canonically `p17`, and no
  source projection conflicts reappear.
  The main new variance is execution-side:
  larger batches add `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` to the current
  arrow-boundary family list.
  The harness now exposes those as explicit per-family summaries rather than
  only raw boundary rows.
  Current read:
  `phistar_50_76` is a small arrow-only epsilon ladder,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` is a single moderate arrow break,
  and `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is the strongest current outlier because it
  combines large arrow violations with `v_dnorm` failures.
  Focused family drilldown is now landed too.
  Current strongest read:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is not a gradual family-wide cone failure;
  it remains interior until a late onset at `t=10->11`, where an arrow sign
  flip and mixed `v_arrow`/`v_dnorm` failure appear together before the final
  structural-signature change on the next step.
  Terminal-step autopsy now shows that the `v_dnorm` part survives several
  alternate normalizations (`raw`, `log_abs`, `robust_z`, `winsor95`,
  `family_minmax`), but only as tiny near-zero positive reversals
  (`~9.4e-13`, `~1.6e-13`).
  That makes the current physics-facing read narrower:
  likely terminal-bin/tail-edge stiffness in the representation or analysis
  layer, not a diffuse breakdown of the learned structural cone.
  The same focused export now anchors that to raw observable context:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is a `7`-bin spectrum, its last bin (`x≈1350`) carries
  the largest fractional uncertainty (`~8.19%`), and the first boundary onset
  happens at the late `alpha=1e4 -> 1e5` jump.
  The local sibling-repo reports also sharpen the claim boundary:
  this same family still has `closestpoint_frac=1.0` and `fejer_set_frac=1.0`,
  while the explicit exception is confined to the MDL-exact surface
  (`MDL_monotone=False`, `2` violations, worst increase `0.694577`).
  So the present read is “late MDL/tail-bin stiffness inside an otherwise
  closest-point / Fejér-admissible family,” not a general structural falsifier.
  The local harness now encodes that distinction explicitly at the family
  summary layer:
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` is promoted to `mdl_tail_boundary` rather than staying
  in the generic `mixed_hard_axis_outlier` bucket, while the per-step witness
  remains `ArrowBoundary`.
  That current-witness fact is now also captured in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/TailBoundaryLemma.agda`, and the current family-count
  artifact `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_lemma_latest.json` reports
  `1` `mdl_tail_boundary` family out of `9` on the checked larger
  `dashifine` family set; the current case is tail-localized and
  terminal-boundary under the local summary rule.
  The widened aggregate now exists too:
  `scripts/tail_boundary_batch.py` produces
  `artifacts/regime_test/tail_boundary_batch_latest.json`, which on the
  currently compatible three-batch `dashifine` set reports
  `2` `mdl_tail_boundary` instances across `3` datasets, still with only one
  unique family (`ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms`), and both observed instances remain
  tail-localized and terminal-boundary.
  The same aggregate now also gives the negative-control split directly:
  repeated `pTll` families plus `dijet_chi_7tev_cms` and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas` stay interior,
  `phistar_50_76` repeats only as `arrow_ladder`,
  `z_pt_7tev_atlas` repeats only as `single_arrow_break`,
  and only `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` repeats as `mdl_tail_boundary`.
  The same artifact also records the current expansion inventory:
  there are only `3` compatible step files in `dashifine` right now.
  Among the `7` current tail-candidate families, only
  `ttbar_mtt_8tev_cms` and `z_pt_7tev_atlas` leave the interior, so the next
  in-repo tail-candidate priorities after `ttbar` are `z_pt_7tev_atlas` and
  then the still-interior heavy-spectrum candidates
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev`, `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev`,
  `dijet_chi_13tev_cms_mgt6`, `dijet_chi_7tev_cms`, and
  `hgg_pt_8tev_atlas`.
  The current focused `z_pt_7tev_atlas` drilldown now narrows that family too:
  it remains a `single_arrow_break`, not a second `mdl_tail_boundary`.
  Current local read:
  one late tail-localized step (`t=9->10`) with `arrow_delta≈0.0305551`,
  no non-arrow failure, all tested `v_dnorm` variants still nonincreasing, and
  clearance under the `lenient` profile.
  The first still-interior heavy-spectrum candidate is now checked too:
  `atlas_4l_m4l_8tev` stays fully interior on the same all-batch run:
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
  The next heavy-spectrum control `atlas_4l_pt4l_8tev` is now checked too and
  stays fully interior under the same criteria:
  `12` steps, `0` boundary steps, `closestpoint_frac=1.0`,
  `fejer_set_frac=1.0`, `MDL_monotone=True`, no onset event, and its last bin
  is not the max-fractional-uncertainty tail bin.
  this is enough to say the bridge is no longer purely heuristic on the
  source-side, but not yet enough to call the mismatch a theorem-grade basin
  escape.
  The remaining uncertainty is now localized:
  either the `Hub` trace read is too crude,
  or the DASL source model needs a richer class table than the current
  encoding-prior parser exposes.
- Naming discipline for current artifacts:
  the present predicate is best read as `source_support_ok`.
  `basin_ok` is retained only as the bridge-facing compatibility alias in the
  execution/witness exports and currently means support under the parsed DASL
  eigenspace prior, not a full class-level source projection verdict.
- Immediate classifier-refinement task:
  the next local patch should replace the trace-side `Hub` heuristic with a
  profile-based eigenspace classifier and export both legacy and refined labels
  side by side.
  Reason:
  the current unsupported `pTll_76_106` case is driven by the old rule
  “positive first structural-signature coordinate ⇒ Hub”, which is too crude to
  carry theorem-grade weight.
- That classifier refinement is now landed.
  The current artifacts export both `legacy_trace_eigenspace` and the refined
  `trace_eigenspace`.
  On the checked `dashifine` trace family:
  `legacy_vs_refined_trace_agreement = 4/5`,
  and the only changed family is `pTll_76_106`, which now moves from legacy
  `Hub` to refined `Spoke`.
- Immediate consequence:
  the previously localized `12/60` unsupported block disappears under the
  refined classifier.
  The current strict-profile source-support result is now `60/60`
  `source_support_ok`.
- Current best reading after that rerun:
  the earlier `pTll_76_106` source mismatch was a trace-labeler artifact, not
  evidence of a real basin miss.
  The remaining live source-side limitation is now narrower:
  the DASL source model is still only being consumed as a compact prior rather
  than a richer class table, even though the sibling source code already fixes
  all `15` Monster primes and their eigenspace partition.
- Immediate next source-lattice pass:
  promote the parsed DASL source prior from the small encoding map
  (`2,3,5,7,11,13,47,59,71`) to the full Monster-prime catalog from
  `MONSTER_PRIMES`, carrying all `Earth/Spoke/Hub/Clock` prime classes into the
  exported source model and source-support mode.
- That source-catalog promotion is now landed.
  The default DASL source mode in `scripts/regime_test.py cone` is now
  `monster-primes` rather than the smaller encoding prior.
  The exported source JSON now records all `15` Monster primes and their
  eigenspace distribution:
  `Earth=0.4667`, `Spoke=0.4`, `Hub=0.0667`, `Clock=0.0667`.
- Current direct result under that richer source catalog:
  the checked `dashifine` trace still reads
  `56` `Interior`,
  `4` `ArrowBoundary`,
  `60/60` `source_support_ok`.
  So the bridge remains stable after both trace-side classifier refinement and
  source-side catalog enrichment.
- An explicit source-projection surface now sits above that richer catalog.
- Carrier-level Moonshine/Ogg match is now separated from the saturated
  Hecke-side `15` scalar question.
  `Ontology/Hecke/MoonshinePrimeCarrierMatch.agda` proves that the intrinsic
  `SSP` carrier is exactly the canonical 15-prime Monster/Ogg list
  `2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,41,47,59,71`, and
  `scripts/check_monster_prime_carrier_match.py` provides the matching cheap
  runtime check for the Python-side catalog.
  This does not upgrade `forcedStableCount = 15` into an Ogg/Monster theorem;
  it only settles that the current 15-lane carrier really is that canonical
  15-prime set.
- The next bridge layer is now implemented as a real closure-side surface in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelectionBridge.agda`.
  It packages what is currently theorem-bearing on the existing closure path:
  prime witnesses on the transported 15-lane carrier,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported prime embedding,
  coarse/step commutation for the transported Hecke signature,
  and the current lower-bound bridge
  `illegalCount_chamber <= forcedStableCount_hist`.
  The stronger MDL concentration and non-accidental isolation clauses remain
  explicit open targets there (`PrimeInvarianceTarget`,
  `PrimeIsolationTarget`) rather than silently assumed.
  It is currently a canonical class-to-prime projection proxy chosen by
  matching refined trace eigenspace and then selecting the highest-exponent
  source prime in that class (lowest prime as tie-break).
  On the checked five-trace family:
  Earth-family traces project to `p2 / T_2 / exponent 46`,
  and the refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` projects to
  `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`.
- The first light invariance layer above that bridge is now explicit in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeInvariance.agda`.
  It proves support-level transport on the canonical 15-prime carrier across
  the already-landed
  `shiftCoarse (shiftStep x) ~ shiftStep (shiftCoarse x)` commutation law,
  and it now also proves the present support-level no-growth statement over
  the existing execution-admissibility boundary.
  So the remaining gap is no longer support transport or support no-growth;
  it is the stronger MDL concentration / isolation claim beyond this
  support-level theorem.
- The next stronger light layer above support is now explicit in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeConcentration.agda`.
  That module moves the selection question to exponent level:
  `PrimeWeight`,
  `PrimeDominates`,
  `PrimeConcentrated`.
  It already proves weight transport across the existing coarse/step
  commutation law, and leaves the right next open targets explicit:
  existence of a concentrated prime and no-loss of concentration under
  admissible descent.
  So the current gap is no longer “support-level invariance” but a genuinely
  selective concentration theorem on the canonical 15-prime carrier.
- The next thin control surface above concentration is now explicit in
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CanonicalPrimeSelector.agda`.
  That lane is now partly discharged, not just named.
  The selector is explicit on the canonical 15-prime carrier:
  highest exponent, lowest prime on ties.
  `selector-sound` is now proved on the Agda side.
  The remaining selection problem is narrower:
  selector no-loss under admissible descent,
  and selector commutation with the current coarse/step schedule.
  The matching runtime helper
  `scripts/select_canonical_prime.py`
  implements the same explicit rule.
  So the selection gap is now phrased as a concrete selector theorem rather
  than a loose concentration narrative.
  For the still-open selector commutation claim, the repo now also has a cheap
  Python probe:
  `scripts/check_selector_step_coarse.py`.
  It compares two concrete transported `MoonshinePrimeState` payloads treated
  as `coarse(step(x))` and `step(coarse(x))`, then checks whether the runtime
  selector agrees on both sides.
  This is evidence/counterexample infrastructure only, not a replacement for
  the Agda theorem.
  The first repo-native way to materialize that bundle is now
  `scripts/build_selector_step_coarse_bundle.py`, which reuses the current
  Agda-backed orientation-prime adapter and emits the required
  `coarse_step` / `step_coarse` shape directly.
  This is still a bridge-aligned probe, not a full independent evaluator of
  the live `shiftCoarse` / `shiftStep` schedule.
- Claim boundary remains:
  this is a controlled source-projection surface, not yet a geometric nearest
  prime/class theorem.
- Immediate next refinement:
  add a scored source-prime ranking over the current source catalog and export
  the top-ranked candidates, so the source projection surface says more than
  “same eigenspace, highest exponent” while still remaining explicitly
  heuristic rather than geometric.
- That scored ranking surface is now landed.
  On the checked traces, Earth-family rows still rank `p2` first.
  The refined `Spoke` trace `pTll_76_106` is now the first place where the
  canonical and scored views differ:
  canonical source projection = `p17 / T_17 / exponent 1`,
  scored shortlist = `p59`, `p71`, then `p17`.
- Current best reading:
  this is the first source-side hint that the Spoke family may want a richer
  projection rule than “highest exponent in class”.
  But it is still only a ranked heuristic surface, not yet a promoted source
  theorem.

## 2026-03-14

- Closure hygiene runtime policy is now stricter:
  routine `run_closure_hygiene` runs should skip learned `heavy` and
  `aggregator` tasks by default.
- Heavy aggregate entrypoints such as
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` remain opt-in integration checks, enabled only with
  an explicit `--include-heavy` flag.
- Reason:
  child-module typechecks are the routine correctness signal, while the
  aggregate summaries are packaging/integration surfaces with multi-hour
  runtimes.
- The canonical grouped ladder path was also decoupled from
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, so local closure-bundle checks should no
  longer force the 9-hour validation surface.

## 2026-03-12 (get-shit-done planning pass)

- Converted the module-by-module closure roadmap into an execution-ready
  checklist with concrete file targets and theorem identifiers:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`.
- Mapped naming differences explicitly:
  `WaveLiftIntoEven` / `WaveLift⇒Even` are implemented in
  `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` and consumed canonically via
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda`;
  `AxiomLaws` lives in `DASHI/Physics/AxiomSet.agda`.
- Updated project memory to set this checklist as the active execution source:
  `plan.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`, `devlog.md`.
- Next routed skill is `long-running-development` to execute the checklist in
  strict order.

## 2026-03-12

- Performed a docs/TODO/status consistency pass against current implementation
  for canonical Stage C bridge surfaces.
- Confirmed the implemented canonical route includes:
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> CausalForcesLorentz31
  -> ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem
  -> QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem
  -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`.
- Confirmed `WaveLift⇒Even` theorem shape is already landed with:
  `CliffordGrading`, `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical wave lift, and witness-form
  factorization through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`; closed matching stale TODO items.
- Updated docs to keep canonical-chain language aligned with shipped modules:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Targeted checks run during this sync (all pass):
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- Canonical projection/defect split bridge cleanup completed:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now carries local proofs for
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`, removing
  those passthrough dependencies on `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` universal seam is now upgraded from a
  raw placeholder to an explicit factorization interface carrying:
  target carrier, factor map, and generator-compatibility witness.
- WaveLift closure direction is now frozen as strictly downstream:
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- Canonical quadratic-to-Clifford bridge landed as a separate theorem module:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda`.
  It consumes `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` directly, exposes
  normalized-quadratic transport via `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`, constructs a
  canonical bilinear-form surface from normalized quadratic data, and adds an
  explicit universal-property seam field on the theorem record.
- `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` now exports that canonical
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge surfaces.
- Implementation contract for this turn:
  - harden canonical `Quadratic⇒Clifford` bridge surface first;
  - add canonical Clifford grading + `Cl⁺` interface;
  - define canonical wave lift in that same carrier pipeline using even-word
    construction;
  - prove a factorization witness through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`.
- Do not introduce a separate wave algebra disconnected from the canonical
  quadratic/Clifford closure chain.

- Quadratic=>Signature completion direction is now pinned:
  preserve the canonical bridge surface
  (`ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`) unchanged, but move
  signature forcing internals to a theorem-primary causal classification path.
- Canonical signature choke-point module promoted in docs:
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`.
  Intended internal split:
  Lemma A (eliminate Euclidean/degenerate competitors) and
  Lemma B (spatial isotropy + arrow + finite speed force `(3,1)`),
  with normalization tied to
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- Orbit-profile evidence remains in the route as secondary witness/cross-check,
  not the primary theorem source.
- Canonical contraction=>quadratic tightening landed on the bottleneck path:
  - added `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`
    as the dedicated split/parallelogram bridge surface.
  - rewired
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.agda` and
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`
    to consume the canonical projection-defect package from that bridge.
  - kept
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
    unchanged at the interface level (still consuming
    `uniqueUpToScaleWitness` from the strengthened theorem).
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now explicitly carries
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields.

- Added new canonical seam bridge module:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem.agda`.
- Export wiring is complete across Stage-C surfaces:
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and
  `Everything`.
- Verification policy update remains active:
  no routine full check of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`
  until runtime bounds improve (last observed full runtime about 1.25h).
- Targeted check outcome under explicit 2-minute timeout:
  new bridge module typechecks; broader Stage-C bundle scope checks time out
  (`exit 124`) due dependency breadth, with no emitted type errors before
  timeout.
- Primary mathematical bottleneck is unchanged:
  discharge strengthened contraction `uniqueUpToScale` seam and thread it into
  signature/Clifford/spin closure chain.

## 2026-03-08

- Canonical archived thread checked:
  online UUID `69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`
  resolved locally to canonical thread
  `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`
  titled `Math Prof Outreach Stage`.
- Current repo docs already say the orbit profile is closest to
  Weyl/Coxeter orbit statistics, theta-series-like shell fingerprints, and
  weight-enumerator-like profiles.
- The missing explicit clarification was the ordering of downstream
  interpretations:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  then Niemeier/umbral-style only if a root-lattice shell model genuinely
  appears,
  then Monster only with graded-module / trace-level structure.
- Safe vocabulary for the current repo state:
  `pre-moonshine`.
  Meaning:
  shell orbit enumerators, shell polynomials, and Weyl/root-system
  combinatorics are in scope;
  graded traces, VOA-level bridges, and Monster claims are not.
- The current `B₄` test remains a structural shell-neighborhood check, not a
  moonshine claim surface.

## Context Fetch Discipline

- When current docs feel light, stale, or too paraphrased, check the local chat
  archive first via the `robust-context-fetch` workflow.
- If the relevant thread is not known locally, check with the user whether they
  know an online chat title or UUID worth pulling into the archive.
- For any referenced or mentioned chat, always record:
  title,
  online UUID if known,
  canonical thread ID if resolved,
  source used (`db` or `web`),
  and the main topics pulled from that thread.
- Prefer the local DB as canonical context when it has an exact match; only use
  web fallback when the DB is missing the needed thread or appears stale.

## 2026-03-09

- Cleanup/refactor turn is landed.
- Short-path ladder modules and ladder-map modules now exist for the current
  closure/moonshine wave-regime hotspot.
- The stale summary export surface was cleaned, and top-level compile is green
  again.
- The repo can now safely resume the `1/2/3/4` widening loop from the cleaned
  canonical Stage C path.
- Post-cleanup widening is active again; the current wave-regime ladder has
  resumed from the cleaned canonical summary surface.
- A follow-up consolidation turn is now active:
  grouped ladder modules are being made authoritative for canonical imports,
  while per-rung wave-regime modules remain compatibility surfaces.
- The current resumed widening loop now includes the short-path
  `Clarity` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on:
  the parametric algebra side,
  the recovered known-limits side,
  the canonical consumer side,
  and the parallel moonshine summary side.
- Math-prof outreach docs should now cite canonical Agda module paths first,
  then repo-facing summary/export surfaces, and only use `all_code44.txt` as a
  corroborating bundled index.
- The outreach note set for thread `Math Prof Outreach Stage`
  (`69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`,
  canonical `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`, source `db`)
  should keep three layers separate:
  mathematical closure spine,
  local scaffolds,
  still-open physics gaps.
- Crosswalk against `../dashifine/MATH_PROF_OUTREACH_CROSSWALK.md` now sharpens
  the status:
  wave / psi / graded-series bridge is strongly scaffolded,
  gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction is substantially scaffolded,
  quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program is more explicit,
  but the core open gaps remain:
  natural physical dynamics law,
  conserved physical quantity,
  explicit continuum-limit theorem,
  realization-independent proof,
  and full gauge/matter recovery as theorem.
Cleanup state:
- local wave-regime ladder is frozen
- grouped ladder modules are now the intended internal API
- `Canonical.LocalProgramBundle` is the new grouped local entrypoint
- broader-than-local widening resumes after remaining summary import cleanup

## 2026-03-10

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` via `chat_context_resolver.py` against canonical
  thread `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998` (“Math Prof Outreach
  Stage”). Source: `db`; online UUID not needed. Main topics pulled:
  - the `B₄` comparison task is already documented as a shell-neighborhood
    classifier with a blocked Lorentz promotion; the touring modules now
    say the same.
  - the shift realization sits on a rigid orbit-count family
    `[4(m−1)(m−2),2(m−1),2]`, so `[24,6,2]` is the first nontrivial
    member, and the orbit-profile story encodes the block-preserving
    signed-permutation symmetry you are already modeling.
- the closure sequence must keep highlighting the rigorous dynamics / orbit
  structure: the latest advice is to trust the existing math spine and keep
  focusing on the hard locking points (dynamics law, conserved quantity,
  continuum limit, realization independence).
- the canonical summary export now intentionally cites these module paths
  plus the `B₄` comparison modules, so follow-up docs should keep referencing
  those paths first.
- the canonical Stage C tower now also exports a `ContractionForcesQuadratic`
  theorem that bundles the contraction/energy structure with the derived
  quadratic invariant and the Lorentz signature placeholder, so the physics
  claim is now tied to a named canonical theorem rather than just an architecture.
  - `KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem` now packages the full gauge/matter
    recovery as a canonical Stage C export, and both the GR and QFT bridge
    theorems now depend on it instead of the weaker matter-gauge record.
    The orchestrator’s long-running-development cycle has run to completion,
    so the current theory milestone is now considered fully finished.
- canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers now rely on
  recovery wave-regime wrappers instead of per-rung imports.
- added a profile-rigidity aggregate report (self, synthetic one-minus,
  Bool inversion, tail-permutation) and surfaced it in the validation summary.
- attempted an autonomous orchestrator run; it failed because network access to
  the Codex backend is blocked in this environment.
- added a χ² boundary theorem wrapper (`Chi2BoundaryShiftTheorem`) and exposed
  it in the validation summary; next priorities target falsifiability boundary
  interfaces and observable-collapse harness wiring.
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report for the
  shift profile (mirror-signature exclusion + competing 4D profile failures),
  wired into the validation summary; updated plan/status/TODO/docs accordingly.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and wired a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict into the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching
  the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open form while keeping explicit
  aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  that the next snap-threshold step requires a non-shift severity/snap witness
  before a second-realization harness can be built.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift placeholder while waiting on a closure-compatible
  realization.
- replaced that provisional synthetic-bool snap-threshold placeholder with a
  synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`)
  that still uses the synthetic severity policy as a proxy, and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import surface to consume it.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type plus a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the
  shift snap witness), and reset the next extension to a Bool inversion-specific
  witness and the B₄ harness.
- the Stage C five-pillar closure target is now explicitly captured by
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem.agda` and exported
  through canonical Stage C theorem + summary + validation surfaces.
- audit correction: that five-pillar theorem is packaging-level; the
  bottleneck proof remains open. New active bottleneck modules:
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`.
- `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries a concrete invariant witness
  field and a first canonical identity-dynamics witness constructor, while
  uniqueness-up-to-scale remains the explicit open seam.
- canonical Stage C/theorem/summary/validation surfaces now export a
  nontrivial strengthened contraction witness based on signed-permutation
  quadratic invariance in 4D.
- canonical Stage C now also exports
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`, tying the strengthened
  contraction witness to the current signature31 theorem surface while keeping
  uniqueness-up-to-scale as an explicit pending obligation.
- active cleanup focus on the bottleneck modules is to replace those raw
  pending `Set` obligations with named seam packages so the remaining
  contraction→quadratic and quadratic→signature gaps are explicit and stable in
  the canonical export surface.
- autonomous orchestrator run on 2026-03-11 selected
  `long-running-development` and failed with exit code `1` because network
  calls to Codex backend/MCP endpoints were blocked.

## 2026-03-24

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` for online thread
  `69c26f38-10ac-839b-abb2-513bd8277db6`, pulled it into the canonical archive,
  and resolved canonical thread
  `17603dbe65e67fb7c87ebfbb64b1a66b5ec04449` (“Formal Proof Pipeline”).
  Source used for the final resolution: `db`. Main topics pulled:
  - “the proof is the path” is the intended formal reading for the current
    repo direction: the proof object should be modeled as an admissible path /
    trajectory, not as a detached theorem artifact.
  - the next formalization step should make HME a small typed Agda path algebra
    over seams the repo already treats as canonical, rather than introducing a
    second proof route.
  - Casey, SL, and Zelph should be exposed as separate interface surfaces over
    that same path algebra; do not collapse them into a single layer or claim
    they are interchangeable.
  - keep `ClosureAxioms` and the contraction/quadratic/signature/Clifford spine
    as the frozen canonical bridge, with orbit-profile evidence treated as
    secondary witness structure rather than the primary theorem source.

## 2026-03-25 (HME Pipeline Contract)

- Documented the full SL ↔ DA51 ↔ Agda boundary contract and pipeline tooling:
  * `DASHI/HME/Trace.agda` now mirrors the canonical witness/schema interchange,
    so the proof layer stays untouched while SL can advertise `TraceWitness`,
    `CanonicalWitness`, and `ProofStatus`.
  * `scripts/hme_pipeline.py` produces normalized traces, MDL + entropy scores,
    multi-attractor cone checks, k-means clustering, silhouette scoring, and
    invariance metrics; `scripts/hme_cli.py` turns a JSON trace list and
    optional attractors into canonical witness payloads.
  * `scripts/hme_emit_agda.py` takes CLI JSON output and writes
    `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` so Agda can import `canonicalWitnesses`
    without a foreign parser; the JSON input is expected to be a list of DA51
    traces (each with `exponents` length 15 plus `hot`, `cold`, `basin`, `j_fixed`)
    and optional attractor arrays of the same length.
  * Recorded that the canonical loop remains: SL structures the data, Agda
    handles admissibility, and feedback to SL flows through `ProofStatus`.
- Added `scripts/data/demo_traces.json` as the current curated DA51 trace
  placeholder (15-entry exponent vectors plus `hot`, `cold`, `basin`, `j_fixed`)
  so `scripts/hme_cli.py` has deterministic inputs, and generated
  `DASHI/HME/Generated/Witnesses.agda` from that CLI run as a proof-of-concept
  ingestion module instead of requiring runtime JSON parsing.
- Re-run that pipeline using the `SensibLaw/scripts/qg_unification_smoke.py`
  payload so the recorded canonical witness now matches the actual QG/SL smoke
  sample, and stored `(qg_smoke_raw.json, qg_trace.json, qg_witness.json)` in
  `scripts/data/` as trace + canonical witness artifacts for future auditing.

## 2026-03-11

- New engineering hardening track started for cyclic Base369 operators:
  - objective: reduce recursive normalization from `spin` in core ring-style
    operators by introducing closed-form index arithmetic counterparts.
  - sequencing decision: migrate triadic operators first with an explicit
    correctness bridge; keep hex/nonary migration as staged follow-up.
  - behavioral policy: preserve old semantics and keep compatibility surfaces
    while downstream modules adopt closed-form variants incrementally.
- `abstract` rollout is now staged across closure summary surfaces:
  first `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` theorem/summary aliases, then
  aggregate bundle values in `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, each via opaque `*-abs` wrappers with stable
  exported names preserved.
- that rollout now covers the full moonshine/regime alias block in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` through the `RegimeResilience` summary
  aliases, still preserving exported names and keeping behavior unchanged.
- canonical-architecture guardrail is now explicit in repo docs:
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` defines a single Stage C theorem chain and
  requires closure modules to be labeled `canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`; README/TODO/plan now point to and enforce that map.
- first concrete label registry is now populated in
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` and repo-facing citation order is explicitly
  canonical-first, then supporting, then experimental.
- Cross-realization snap-threshold package is now complete at the current
  benchmark layer:
  - Bool inversion harness now uses its own witness module
    (`Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness`) rather than reusing the shift witness.
  - A standalone `B₄` harness (`SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4`) is now exported
    through `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` as `snapThresholdB4Verdict`.
  - Next extension is to replace shell-only `B₄` severity with an
    orientation/signature-aware admissible witness surface.
- audit decision (2026-03-11):
  keep orchestrator-generated Bool-inversion/B₄ validation modules and related
  summary wiring as the new baseline (they compile and align with roadmap),
  but keep closure milestone open until `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` is discharged.

## 2026-03-11 (Spine Simplification Decision)

- Canonical planning decision: collapse quadratic emergence to one route through
  the parallelogram/polarization theorem path.
- Canonical closure spine is now documented as:
  `ProjectionDefect → EnergySplitProof → Parallelogram → QuadraticForm
  → ConeTimeIsotropy → Signature31FromConeArrowIsotropy → Signature31Lock`.
- Parallel modules in the quadratic/signature family are retained but re-scoped:
  they are `alternative` or `validation` routes, not closure-critical steps.
- Active open seams should be listed only on canonical contraction/quadratic and
  quadratic/signature bridge surfaces, not duplicated across parallel routes.
- Next execution skill selected: `long-running-development` for import rewiring,
  seam-surface cleanup, and compile-stable migration.

## 2026-03-29 (Ultrametric FP formal layer + scalar refinement)

- Context source (db): online UUID `69c3f3ed-3d94-839d-b562-44005a50bf82`, title “Ultrametric fixed‑point lemmas for DASHI”, canonical ID `60b7dd7192b53ed5bac2f705aa6039321759469f`.
- Added formal shells: `Physics/PhysicalTheory.agda`, `Refinement.agda`, `SymmetryQuotient.agda`, `Observable.agda`, `QuantumHistory.agda`, `Measurement.agda`, `ClassicalEmergence.agda`, `Benchmark.agda`, `CandidateFieldTheory.agda`, `PhysicalTheoryShell.agda`.
- Added `Physics/LocalWitness.agda` to carry local operator/scaling/observable-invariance witnesses for shell-level toys.
- Scalar continuum toy now uses a more symmetric centered local relaxation (`centerGate` / `relaxSymVec`) rather than the earlier one-sided gate, carries a nontrivial global sign-flip action plus support quotient, and keeps the same recovery surface. The refinement tower is now explicitly approximate rather than exact; the current `approxEq₀` witness is deliberately coarse (`⊤`) and should be sharpened later.
- RG universality toy now also has a nontrivial quotient on the irrelevant sector rather than a quotient-trivial shell: relevant coordinate preserved, irrelevant sector contracts via the scalar relaxation, refinement projects only the irrelevant tail, and the shell carries local operator/scaling/observable witnesses.
- Added `Physics/Toy/GaugeShell.agda`: a shell-level gauge toy in which the gauge origin is pure gauge and the field carrier is the physical quotient. The local step contracts field content, observables read only the field, and recovery says the field relaxes to vacuum modulo gauge.
- Next work: sharpen the scalar approximate refinement witness beyond the current coarse boundary witness, then push the same quotient/witness pattern into later toys beyond scalar/RG/gauge.
- Refresh (db pull 2026-03-29): same thread reiterates that global availability of operators/symmetry/observables/scaling is not sufficient; each toy must *instantiate and use* them locally (operator algebra, scaling limit, observable statement, quotient invariance). Do not assume commutation; treat refinement/projection non-commutation as a target and use approxEq witnesses per theory.
- Refresh correction (db analysis 2026-03-29): the thread does contain explicit code/module artifacts, including module/file names and pasted edit summaries for `DASHI/Physics/*.agda` and `DASHI/Physics/Toy/ScalarContinuum.agda`; it is not only high-level planning text.

## 2026-03-29 (CLOCK / DASHI phase schema refresh)

- Context source (db): online UUID `69c8913d-5240-839b-9bf8-d757ae8b208a`, title `Resonance and Overlap`, canonical ID `343e73cc6a60cd1f29be15301a69aed0fa682002`.
- Main correction: CLOCK should currently be treated as a cyclic `HexTruth` / `ℤ/6` lift of DASHI’s triadic `TriTruth` / `ℤ/3`, not as a dihedral `⟨r,s⟩` object. Safe formal relation: `CLOCK = fine phase`, `DASHI = coarse phase`, with the coarse map the mod-3 projection `HexTruth → TriTruth`.
- Safe phase dynamics schema pulled from the thread:
  `phase : S → HexTruth`, `coarsePhase x = q (phase x)`, and for the intended dynamics `T : S → S`,
  `coarse (phase (T² x)) = rotateTri (coarse (phase x))`.
- Repo-facing interpretation boundary:
  phase carriers alone are kinematics; the physics content comes only once cone admissibility, contraction / Lyapunov descent, and MDL are imposed on top of the phase lift.
- Design consequence for future formalization:
  if a CLOCK/DASHI bridge module is added, it should be phrased as a cyclic refinement / square-root lift with dynamic retention-collapse semantics under cone + contraction + MDL, not as a reversal-involution theorem.
- Implementation landed in `DASHI/Physics/CLOCKPhaseBridge.agda`:
  `coarseHex : HexTruth → TriTruth` is now the actual mod-3 coarse map, with the proved law
  `coarseHex (rotateHex h) = rotateTri (coarseHex h)`.
  The thread’s state-level law is packaged as a separate witness
  `phase-step² : phase (T² x) = rotateHex (phase x)`,
  from which the bridge proves
  `coarse (phase (T² x)) = rotateTri (coarse (phase x))`.
  This keeps the cyclic interpretation while avoiding the earlier mismatch between a literal one-step hex advance and the thread’s stated `T²` coarse law.
- Concrete instance landed in `DASHI/Physics/CLOCKPhaseInstance.agda`:
  `ClockState = HexTruth × Bool` as a two-phase lagged clock, with
  `clockStep (h , false) = (h , true)` and
  `clockStep (h , true) = (rotateHex h , false)`.
  This discharges the actual witness `phase (T² x) = rotateHex (phase x)` on a nontrivial state space and yields the concrete theorem
  `coarsePhase (T² x) = rotateTri (coarsePhase x)`.
  It is intentionally only a kinematic instance; no false strict-contraction claim is made for the raw periodic cycle.
- Follow-up implementation (2026-03-29): the CLOCK instance now also exposes a stroboscopic effective layer:
  `StrobeState = HexTruth`, `strobeStep = rotateHex`, `strobeEmbed h = (h , false)`,
  together with `step² (strobeEmbed h) = strobeEmbed (strobeStep h)` and the coarse dynamics theorem
  `coarsePhase (T² (strobeEmbed h)) = rotateTri (coarsePhase (strobeEmbed h))`.
  This is the intended “effective coarse dynamics” layer without claiming raw-cycle contraction.
- Lane follow-up (2026-03-29): `CLOCKPhaseInstance` now packages that effective layer as
  `EffectiveClockClosure`, with an invariant, step² preservation, a lag-defect Lyapunov condition,
  and coarse triadic phase evolution on the stroboscopic sector.
- Second-rung CLOCK lane result: `CLOCKPhaseInstance` now also carries a concrete cone/admissibility layer,
  with `ClockCone`, `clockStep²-conePreserved`, and `EffectiveClockCone`.
  The effective clock sector is now not only Lyapunov-packaged but explicitly equipped with a preserved cone on `step²`.
- Third-rung CLOCK lane result: `CLOCKPhaseInstance` now defines `PhasePhysicsBridgeStep²` and instantiates it as
  `clockBridgeStep²`, tightening the bridge from the concrete effective clock sector back to a generic step²-level
  phase/admissibility/defect package without making an unjustified raw-step contraction claim.
- Local follow-up: the clock line now makes the step²-only choice explicit by adding
  `strobeProject`, `strobeEmbedProject-onInv`, `strobeProject-step²`, and `EffectiveClockSectorBridge`.
  The current formal stance is therefore: the effective stroboscopic sector is the honest bridge surface,
  rather than pretending the raw one-step clock dynamics satisfies the stronger generic bridge.
- Additional local follow-up: `normalizeToStrobe`, `normalizeToStrobe-inv`,
  `normalizeToStrobe-id-onInv`, `normalizeToStrobe-is-step-if-needed`, and `normalizeToStrobe-step²`
  now make the sector-entry story explicit: every state reaches the stroboscopic sector in at most one raw step,
  and the step² dynamics can then be read through the normalized stroboscopic projection.
- Latest local follow-up: the CLOCK line now effectively has a named one-step-entry bundle,
  combining normalization to the stroboscopic sector with the previously added sector bridge and step² phase package.
- Scalar refinement is no longer using `approxEq₀ = ⊤`.
  `ScalarContinuum` now tracks agreement on every coordinate except the last, via a recursive `TailApprox`,
  and proves the refinement witness against the actual centered local relaxation.
- RG refinement automatically sharpened through that scalar change, and `RGUniversality` now states explicit
  basin-label invariance, irrelevant-size contraction under step/coarse, a relevance/irrelevance scaling split,
  and recovered-class / observable-collapse lemmas parameterized by the basin label.
- Additional RG lane content landed:
  `rgCoarseStepApprox`, `rgCoarseStepClass-stable`, `rgCoarseRelObservableStable`,
  and `rgCoarseIrrelObservableMonotone`, so the toy now states one-step coarse/step compatibility
  and observable stability/monotonicity at the coarse interface.
- Second-rung RG lane result: `RGUniversality` now has iterated theorem content:
  `stepPow`, `coarsePow`, basin-label preservation under arbitrary step/coarse iteration,
  irrelevant-size monotonicity under arbitrary iteration, and corresponding relevant/irrelevant observable
  stability/monotonicity lemmas over repeated coarse projection.
- Third-rung RG lane result: `RGUniversality` now packages the step-iterate side as an explicit
  asymptotic bundle, `rgAsymptotic` with witness `rgAsymptoticWitness`, stating fixed basin label,
  nonincreasing irrelevance size, boundedness by the initial state, constancy of the relevance observable,
  and monotonicity of the irrelevance observable across arbitrary `stepPow` iterates.
- Local follow-up: `RGUniversality` now also defines `rgCanonicalClass`,
  `rgRecovered-stepPow-canonical`, and `rgRecovered-stepPow-canonical-observable`,
  so recovered iterates are explicitly tied to a canonical basin representative indexed by the relevant coordinate.
- Additional local follow-up: `rgRecovered-fixed`, `rgRecovered-stepPow-id`,
  `rgRecovered-stepPow-from`, `rgRecovered-stepPow-tail-canonical`, and
  `rgRecovered-stepPow-tail-canonical-observable` now make the “once recovered, always canonical”
  story explicit for all later iterates.
- The RG line is now at the point where remaining work is mostly presentation/consumer-side:
  the asymptotic bundle (`rgAsymptotic`) and the canonical recovered-tail bundle are both present.
- Gauge lane content landed in `GaugeShell`:
  recovered states now collapse to the vacuum quotient class, with class equality between recovered states,
  observable stability on vacuum refinement, and a coarse-vacuum class lemma.
- Second-rung Gauge lane result: `GaugeShell` now includes one-step coarse/step compatibility
  (`gaugeCoarseStepApprox`) and coarse-step defect/observable monotonicity
  (`gaugeCoarseStepDefect≤FineStep`, `gaugeCoarseStepObservableMonotone`).
- Third-rung Gauge lane result: `GaugeShell` now carries iterated scaling content via `stepPow`, `coarsePow`,
  `gaugeDefect-stepPow-monotone`, `gaugeDefect-coarsePow-monotone`, and
  `gaugeObservable-coarsePow-monotone`, extending the one-step coarse theorems to arbitrary-depth projection.
- Local follow-up: `GaugeShell` now adds `gaugeCanonicalClass`,
  `gaugeRecovered-stepPow-class`, and `gaugeRecovered-stepPow-observable-collapse`,
  making recovered iterates collapse to the vacuum quotient class and the corresponding canonical observable value.
- Additional local follow-up: `gaugeRecovered-fixed`, `gaugeRecovered-stepPow-id`,
  `gaugeRecovered-stepPow-from`, `gaugeRecovered-stepPow-tail-class`, and
  `gaugeRecovered-stepPow-tail-observable-collapse` now make the same recovered-tail persistence/canonical-collapse
  story explicit for later gauge iterates.
- The Gauge line is now structurally parallel to RG at the recovered-tail level,
  though it still lacks a named asymptotic bundle record if one is wanted for consumer-side uniformity.
- Packaging follow-up: consumer-facing summary modules now exist for all three active lanes:
  `DASHI/Physics/CLOCKPhaseSummaryBundle.agda`,
  `DASHI/Physics/Toy/RGSummaryBundle.agda`,
  and `DASHI/Physics/Toy/GaugeSummaryBundle.agda`.
  CLOCK now exports a bundled closure/cone/bridge/sector surface plus the one-step sector-entry package.
  RG now exports named asymptotic and recovered-tail bundle records.
  Gauge now exports a named asymptotic bundle and recovered-tail bundle parallel to RG.
- Final packaging follow-up: `DASHI/Physics/Toy/UnifiedToySummaryBundle.agda` now gives one cross-toy consumer-facing import surface,
  bundling the CLOCK closure consumer and the RG/Gauge iterate bundles behind a single module.
- RG follow-up: `RGUniversality` now also exposes an explicit renormalization family
  `rgRenormalize k n = rgShellStep n ∘ coarsePow k n`,
  together with basin stability and relevant/irrelevant observable monotonicity theorems,
  packaged as `RGRenormalizationBundle`.
- Latest RG follow-up: the renormalization story is now richer than a single post-coarsening step.
  `RGUniversality` now also defines `rgFlow k m n = stepPow n m ∘ coarsePow k n`,
  together with basin stability, relevant/irrelevant observable monotonicity, and
  canonical-on-recovered theorems, packaged as `RGFlowBundle` and exported through `RGFlowSummary`.
- Schedule follow-up: the RG flow family now also carries explicit fixed-`k` schedule comparison facts.
  `rgFlow-step-monotone` and `rgFlow-irr-observable-step-monotone` compare
  `m` against `suc m` at fixed coarse depth, while
  `rgFlow-step-tail-canonical` and `rgFlow-step-tail-canonical-observable`
  make the recovered-tail/canonical-collapse story explicit after a chosen RG schedule has entered the recovered regime.
- Fused-operator follow-up: `RGUniversality` now also defines a more tightly coupled coarse/evolve family
  `rgFused`, where each recursive coarse step is preceded by a scale-local evolution step rather than being exposed only as `coarsePow` followed by `stepPow`.
  The file now carries `RGFusedBundle` with:
  basin stability,
  irrelevant-size monotonicity,
  relevant/irrelevant observable monotonicity,
  a recovered/canonical-collapse theorem pack,
  and the anchor comparison `rgFused zero = rgFlow zero 1`.
  This is the first genuinely less-factorized RG operator surface in the current encoding.
- Latest fused follow-up: `rgFused` now also carries a recovered-tail persistence layer,
  via `rgFused-step-tail-canonical` and `rgFused-step-tail-canonical-observable`.
  So once the fused operator reaches the recovered regime, all later target-scale evolution remains at the same canonical class/observable, mirroring the stronger flow-side persistence story.
- Comparison follow-up: the RG file now also carries an operator-aware weak comparison layer between `rgFused` and `rgFlow`,
  without invoking failed coarse-depth associativity claims.
  `rgFused-flow-basin-agree` and `rgFused-flow-rel-observable-agree` show that the two operators always agree on the relevant/basin sector,
  and `rgFused-flow-recovered-same-class` plus `rgFused-flow-recovered-observable-agree` show that once both land in the recovered regime,
  they collapse to the same canonical physical class and observables.
- Mixed-schedule follow-up: the RG file now also compares target-scale evolution after the fused operator to a nearby flow schedule at the same coarse depth.
  `rgFused-stepPow-flow-basin-agree` and `rgFused-stepPow-flow-rel-observable-agree`
  give a structural comparison between `stepPow n t (rgFused k n x)` and `rgFlow k (suc t) n x`
  without requiring any coarse-depth associativity theorem.
- Benchmark follow-up: `RGUniversality` now exposes a minimal prediction/data surface for the RG toy.
  `rgPredictionTheory` evaluates `RGObservableExpr` to `Nat`,
  `rgBenchmarkTheory` adds a simple gain parameter,
  and `rgBenchmarkMatch` scores the `rel#` and `irr#` observables with a small total equality-penalty mismatch.
  `RGSummaryBundle` and `UnifiedToySummaryBundle` now expose this prediction/benchmark layer.
- Closure-facing wiring follow-up: `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ToySummaryConsumer.agda` now imports the unified toy bundle
  alongside `Canonical.LocalProgramBundle`, giving the toy theorem surfaces a non-`Toy/` consumer path without overstating their status.

- Benchmark theorem follow-up: the RG line now connects the minimal prediction/data layer back to operator comparison.
  `rgFused-flow-rel-benchmark-agree` lifts fused-vs-flow relevant-sector agreement to benchmark predictions on `rel#`,
  `rgFused-stepPow-flow-rel-benchmark-agree` does the same for the nearby mixed schedule `stepPow ∘ rgFused` versus `rgFlow`,
  and `rgFlow-irr-benchmark-step-monotone` gives a benchmark-facing monotonicity theorem on `irr#` across successive flow steps.
  `RGSummaryBundle` and `UnifiedToySummaryBundle` now expose these benchmark-comparison results through a dedicated summary bundle.

- Full-score/benchmark-surface follow-up: the RG benchmark line now goes beyond single-observable comparison.
  `rgBenchmarkDataset` and `rgBenchmarkSelfMismatch-zero` make the current mismatch score usable as a theorem target,
  and `rgFused-flow-recovered-benchmark-mismatch-zero` lifts fused-vs-flow comparison to the full current mismatch score in the recovered regime.
  Separately, the RG line now has a raw-state schedule-sensitive benchmark surface via `rgRawQuotiented`,
  `rgScheduledPredictionTheory`, and `rgScheduledBenchmarkTheory`, with `rgScheduled-rel-benchmark-stable`
  and `rgScheduled-irr-benchmark-step-monotone` giving the first target-scale schedule theorems on that new surface.
  `RGSummaryBundle` and `UnifiedToySummaryBundle` now expose both the recovered-score comparison and the schedule-sensitive benchmark package.

- Mixed-schedule benchmark follow-up: the RG line now has a scale-aware mixed coarse/evolve schedule family.
  `RGMixedSchedule` and `rgRunMixed` execute alternating evolve/coarse paths on raw pre-coarsened states,
  `rgMixedBenchmarkTheory` and `rgMixedBenchmarkMatch` lift that to a theorem-bearing benchmark surface,
  `rgMixed-rel-benchmark-stable` and `rgMixed-irr-benchmark-bounded` provide the first structural theorems there,
  and `rgUniformMixed-one-is-fused` plus `rgUniformMixed-one-benchmark-agree` connect the new surface back to the existing fused operator.
  `RGSummaryBundle` and `UnifiedToySummaryBundle` now expose this mixed scheduled benchmark layer.

- Mixed-schedule comparison follow-up: the new RG mixed benchmark surface now goes beyond a uniform-one bridge to the fused operator.
  `rgMixed-rel-benchmark-agree` compares any two mixed schedules on the relevant benchmark sector,
  `rgMixed-recovered-same-class` and `rgMixed-recovered-observable-agree` give cross-schedule recovered collapse,
  and `rgMixed-recovered-benchmark-mismatch-zero` lifts that to the full mixed benchmark mismatch score.
  `RGMixedScheduledBenchmarkSummary` now exposes these comparison/recovered-collapse theorems to consumers.

- Mixed-schedule tail follow-up: the RG mixed path layer now has canonical-vacuum persistence after recovery.
  `rgMixed-step-tail-canonical` and `rgMixed-step-tail-canonical-observable` mirror the older fused/flow tail theorems on the mixed schedule surface,
  so once a mixed coarse/evolve path lands in the recovered regime, all later target-scale evolution remains at the same canonical class/observable.
  `RGMixedScheduledBenchmarkSummary` now exposes these tail theorems alongside the mixed comparison/recovered-collapse pack.

- Mixed-schedule benchmark-tail follow-up: the RG mixed path layer now also collapses benchmark mismatch after later target-scale evolution.
  `rgMixed-step-tail-benchmark-mismatch-zero` identifies the canonical-vacuum benchmark score as zero after any recovered mixed schedule is pushed forward by `stepPow`,
  and `rgMixed-step-tail-cross-benchmark-mismatch-zero` does the same across two recovered mixed schedules after matching target-scale evolution.
  `RGMixedScheduledBenchmarkSummary` now exposes these benchmark-tail theorems in the same package as the mixed class/observable tail facts.

- Rich-score follow-up: the RG benchmark line now has a parallel structured score layer instead of only the old two-penalty `Nat`.
  `RGBenchmarkScore` splits mismatch into `endpoint`, `path`, `recovery`, and `scale` channels using the current encoding’s observable proxies,
  `rgRichBenchmarkMatch` and `rgMixedRichBenchmarkMatch` expose that score on the quotient and mixed-schedule surfaces,
  and `rgRichBenchmarkSelfMismatch-zero`, `rgMixedRichBenchmarkSelfMismatch-zero`, and `rgMixed-recovered-rich-benchmark-mismatch-zero`
  show the structured score collapses cleanly in the same self/recovered regimes as the earlier thin score.
  `RGSummaryBundle` and `UnifiedToySummaryBundle` now expose the richer RG benchmark surface in parallel with the old compatibility-preserving one.

- Trace-score follow-up: the RG mixed schedule line now has a trace-aware benchmark surface rather than only endpoint-derived rich proxies.
  `rgMixedPathMass`, `rgMixedRecoveryMass`, and `rgMixedScaleMass` accumulate recursive mixed-schedule path/recovery/scale information across coarse/evolve checkpoints,
  `rgMixedTraceBenchmarkTheory` and `rgMixedTraceBenchmarkMatch` expose those channels through a new mixed trace benchmark layer,
  `rgMixedTraceBenchmarkSelfMismatch-zero` proves the structured trace score vanishes on self-comparison,
  and `rgMixedTraceRecovered-endpoint-zero` states the intended asymmetry: recovered mixed schedules force the endpoint channel to zero, while the trace/recovery/scale channels remain available to distinguish schedules.
  `RGSummaryBundle` and `UnifiedToySummaryBundle` now expose this mixed trace benchmark layer alongside the thinner endpoint-only benchmark surfaces.

- Pre-Phase-2 planning decision:
  treat the current RG benchmark work as sufficient Phase 1 for the existing toy encoding.
  The next implementation phase should not add more collapse lemmas first.
  Phase 2 is operator/state enrichment:
  multiple coarse schemes, multiple evolve modes, and a less trivial fixed-point/family structure.
  Phase 3 then re-states the comparison and universality theorems against that richer hierarchy,
  with explicit room for endpoint agreement but path/scale disagreement on the trace-aware benchmark layer.

- Phase-2 hierarchy landing:
  `RGUniversality` now carries `RGCoarseScheme` (`tailScheme`, `flipTailScheme`),
  `RGFlowMode` (`relaxMode`, `holdMode`),
  and a four-way `RGFixedPoint` surface distinguishing vacuum vs residual and ordered vs disordered sectors.
  The new operator layer is additive rather than disruptive:
  `rgCoarseBy`, `rgStepBy`, `coarsePowBy`, and `rgSchemeFlow` sit alongside the earlier single-path operators,
  while `rgSchemeFlow-basin-stable`, `rgSchemeFlow-rel-observable-stable`,
  `rgSchemeFlow-canonical-on-recovered`, and `rgSchemeFlow-fixedPoint-on-recovered`
  provide the first theorem pack on the richer hierarchy.
  `RGPhase2HierarchyBundle` / `RGPhase2HierarchySummary` / the unified toy bundle now expose this hierarchy for later Phase 3 theorem restatement.

- Phase-2 mixed-path lift:
  the RG path layer now also exists on top of the new scheme/mode hierarchy instead of only the old single-scheme mixed schedule.
  `RGMixedSchedule2`, `rgRunMixed2`, and `uniformMixed2` let mixed schedules choose coarse scheme and evolve mode per layer,
  `rgMixed2-basin-stable` / `rgMixed2-irrelevant-bounded` / `rgMixed2-recovered-same-class` provide the first structural theorem pack there,
  and `rgMixed2TraceBenchmarkTheory` / `rgMixed2TraceBenchmarkMatch` / `rgMixed2TraceRecovered-endpoint-zero`
  lift the trace-aware benchmark surface onto that richer path family.
  `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary` and the unified toy bundle now expose the new Phase-2 mixed path layer for upcoming theorem restatement.

- Phase-3 first split theorem:
  the Phase-2 mixed trace layer is no longer just a proxy wrapper around the old mixed schedule masses.
  `rgMixed2PathMass`, `rgMixed2RecoveryMass`, and `rgMixed2ScaleMass` now carry explicit scheme/mode weights,
  so the Phase-2 trace channels can distinguish schedules even when endpoint class agrees.
  The first concrete theorem is the one-layer vacuum witness:
  `uniformMixed2 tailScheme holdMode ...` and `uniformMixed2 flipTailScheme holdMode ...`
  have the same endpoint class on `rgVacuum`, but `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split`
  proves the trace benchmark still has zero endpoint component and path component `1`.
  `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary` now exports this as `tail-vs-flip-vacuum-split`.

- Phase-3 deeper split extension:
  the same endpoint/path separation now scales beyond the one-layer witness.
  `rgRunUniformMixed2-hold-vacuum`, `rgUniformMixed2-tail-path-on-vacuum`,
  `rgUniformMixed2-flip-path-on-vacuum`, and
  `rgUniformMixed2-tail-vs-flip-trace-benchmark-split`
  show that for any positive uniform coarse depth in `holdMode`,
  tail-vs-flip schedules still collapse to the same vacuum endpoint class while the trace benchmark path channel remains nonzero.
  `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary` now exports this as
  `uniform-tail-vs-flip-positive-depth-split`.

- Phase-3 non-vacuum hold split:
  the split now also survives outside vacuum-only witnesses.
  `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-one-layer-hold-endpoint-class` and
  `rgMixed2-tail-vs-flip-one-layer-hold-path-step`
  show that for any one-layer `holdMode` state, tail-vs-flip schedules share the same endpoint class
  while the raw trace path channel differs by one.
  `RGMixedPhase2TraceBenchmarkSummary` now exports this as
  `one-layer-hold-raw-split`.
- 2026-04-01 context refresh (db): “Dashi and Physics Insights” online ID `69ca43a9-09fc-839b-8cc3-e5ce3868eef5`, canonical `ad17536d8eeb320106585654a0950424abafa93b`, latest ts 2026-03-31 15:52 UTC. Key payload: Forced-Stable Transfer Bridge candidate (illegalCount_chamber ≤ forcedStableCount_hist ≤ forcedStableCount_orbit) and the pre-bridge inequality target illegalCount_chamber(x,p) ≤ forcedStableCount_hist(S(x),p); confirms exact chambers already exist and next theorems should test chamber-stability of defect histograms/correspondences.
- 2026-04-02 noncanonical mdl-level audit refinement:
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSearchAudit.agda` now packages the bounded
  same-carrier search state on `mdlLevel × π-max`. Among the current in-repo
  `ShiftContractState` witnesses, the old coarse pair is retired, the only
  certified prime-image subfamily remains the singleton around
  `coarseCounterexampleLeft`, and no fresh equal-`π-mdl-max` /
  unequal-prime-image pair has yet been recovered. Immediate gap remains
  prime-image control beyond that bounded search scope, with
  `eigenShadow × π-max` still the prepared fallback.
- 2026-04-02 noncanonical refinement continuation:
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelPrimeImageSubfamilyRefinement.agda` now wraps the
  current explicit mdl-level witnesses into a two-point family
  `{ coarseCounterexampleLeft , coarseCounterexampleRight }`, where the
  same-state cases are stable and the mixed case is already excluded at
  `π-mdl-max`.
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelWitnessSourceAudit.agda` now packages the retired
  pair, singleton subfamily, and bounded search wrappers as an exhausted
  same-carrier witness-source boundary.
  `ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryObstruction.agda` turns the prepared
  `eigenShadow × π-max` fallback into a theorem-bearing obstruction: even that
  stronger normalized surface still does not determine the canonical `p2`
  orbit-summary key.
- 2026-04-02 explicit-state/fallback refinement:
  `ShiftContractMdlLevelExplicitStateSearchAudit.agda` now closes the obvious
  direct explicit-state pool on `ShiftContractState`: the retired coarse pair,
  one-hot states, and direct neg/pos tail patterns are all recorded as
  checked, and the pool is exhausted at the `π-mdl-max` seam.
  `ShiftContractEigenShadowOrbitSummaryControlAttempt.agda` packages the
  fallback branch as a direct no-go control schema: normalized
  `eigenShadow × π-max` equality still cannot recover the canonical `p2`
  orbit-summary key.
