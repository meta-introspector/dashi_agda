# Compactified Context

## 2026-03-14

- Closure hygiene runtime policy is now stricter:
  routine `run_closure_hygiene` runs should skip learned `heavy` and
  `aggregator` tasks by default.
- Heavy aggregate entrypoints such as
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda` and
  `DASHI/Everything.agda` remain opt-in integration checks, enabled only with
  an explicit `--include-heavy` flag.
- Reason:
  child-module typechecks are the routine correctness signal, while the
  aggregate summaries are packaging/integration surfaces with multi-hour
  runtimes.
- The canonical grouped ladder path was also decoupled from
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, so local closure-bundle checks should no
  longer force the 9-hour validation surface.

## 2026-03-12 (get-shit-done planning pass)

- Converted the module-by-module closure roadmap into an execution-ready
  checklist with concrete file targets and theorem identifiers:
  `Docs/PhysicsClosureImplementationChecklist.md`.
- Mapped naming differences explicitly:
  `WaveLiftIntoEven` / `WaveLift⇒Even` are implemented in
  `DASHI/Physics/CliffordEvenLiftBridge.agda` and consumed canonically via
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem.agda`;
  `AxiomLaws` lives in `DASHI/Physics/AxiomSet.agda`.
- Updated project memory to set this checklist as the active execution source:
  `plan.md`, `TODO.md`, `status.md`, `devlog.md`.
- Next routed skill is `long-running-development` to execute the checklist in
  strict order.

## 2026-03-12

- Performed a docs/TODO/status consistency pass against current implementation
  for canonical Stage C bridge surfaces.
- Confirmed the implemented canonical route includes:
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> CausalForcesLorentz31
  -> ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem
  -> QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem
  -> CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`.
- Confirmed `WaveLift⇒Even` theorem shape is already landed with:
  `CliffordGrading`, `EvenSubalgebra`, canonical wave lift, and witness-form
  factorization through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`; closed matching stale TODO items.
- Updated docs to keep canonical-chain language aligned with shipped modules:
  `README.md`, `status.md`, `status.json`, `spec.md`, `architecture.md`,
  `plan.md`, `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Targeted checks run during this sync (all pass):
  `CliffordEvenLiftBridge`,
  `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
  `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`,
  `KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`,
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`.

## 2026-03-11

- Canonical projection/defect split bridge cleanup completed:
  `quadraticEmergenceFromProjectionDefectSplit` now carries local proofs for
  `Additive-On-Orth` and `PD-splits` in
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`, removing
  those passthrough dependencies on `QuadraticEmergenceShiftAxioms`.
- `QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem` universal seam is now upgraded from a
  raw placeholder to an explicit factorization interface carrying:
  target carrier, factor map, and generator-compatibility witness.
- WaveLift closure direction is now frozen as strictly downstream:
  `Contraction⇒Quadratic → Quadratic⇒Signature → Quadratic⇒Clifford → WaveLift⇒Even`.
- Canonical quadratic-to-Clifford bridge landed as a separate theorem module:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem.agda`.
  It consumes `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` directly, exposes
  normalized-quadratic transport via `uniqueUpToScaleWitness`, constructs a
  canonical bilinear-form surface from normalized quadratic data, and adds an
  explicit universal-property seam field on the theorem record.
- `CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem` now exports that canonical
  quadratic-to-Clifford theorem package alongside existing bridge surfaces.
- Implementation contract for this turn:
  - harden canonical `Quadratic⇒Clifford` bridge surface first;
  - add canonical Clifford grading + `Cl⁺` interface;
  - define canonical wave lift in that same carrier pipeline using even-word
    construction;
  - prove a factorization witness through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`.
- Do not introduce a separate wave algebra disconnected from the canonical
  quadratic/Clifford closure chain.

- Quadratic=>Signature completion direction is now pinned:
  preserve the canonical bridge surface
  (`ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`) unchanged, but move
  signature forcing internals to a theorem-primary causal classification path.
- Canonical signature choke-point module promoted in docs:
  `DASHI/Geometry/CausalForcesLorentz31.agda`.
  Intended internal split:
  Lemma A (eliminate Euclidean/degenerate competitors) and
  Lemma B (spatial isotropy + arrow + finite speed force `(3,1)`),
  with normalization tied to
  `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.uniqueUpToScaleWitness`.
- Orbit-profile evidence remains in the route as secondary witness/cross-check,
  not the primary theorem source.
- Canonical contraction=>quadratic tightening landed on the bottleneck path:
  - added `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram.agda`
    as the dedicated split/parallelogram bridge surface.
  - rewired
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticTheorem.agda` and
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`
    to consume the canonical projection-defect package from that bridge.
  - kept
    `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem.agda`
    unchanged at the interface level (still consuming
    `uniqueUpToScaleWitness` from the strengthened theorem).
  - `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now explicitly carries
    `invariantUnderT`, `nondegenerate`, and `compatibleWithIsotropy` fields.

- Added new canonical seam bridge module:
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionSignatureToSpinDiracBridgeTheorem.agda`.
- Export wiring is complete across Stage-C surfaces:
  `CanonicalStageC`, `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle`,
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary`, and
  `Everything`.
- Verification policy update remains active:
  no routine full check of
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureValidationSummary.agda`
  until runtime bounds improve (last observed full runtime about 1.25h).
- Targeted check outcome under explicit 2-minute timeout:
  new bridge module typechecks; broader Stage-C bundle scope checks time out
  (`exit 124`) due dependency breadth, with no emitted type errors before
  timeout.
- Primary mathematical bottleneck is unchanged:
  discharge strengthened contraction `uniqueUpToScale` seam and thread it into
  signature/Clifford/spin closure chain.

## 2026-03-08

- Canonical archived thread checked:
  online UUID `69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`
  resolved locally to canonical thread
  `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`
  titled `Math Prof Outreach Stage`.
- Current repo docs already say the orbit profile is closest to
  Weyl/Coxeter orbit statistics, theta-series-like shell fingerprints, and
  weight-enumerator-like profiles.
- The missing explicit clarification was the ordering of downstream
  interpretations:
  Weyl/root-system/theta-like first,
  then Niemeier/umbral-style only if a root-lattice shell model genuinely
  appears,
  then Monster only with graded-module / trace-level structure.
- Safe vocabulary for the current repo state:
  `pre-moonshine`.
  Meaning:
  shell orbit enumerators, shell polynomials, and Weyl/root-system
  combinatorics are in scope;
  graded traces, VOA-level bridges, and Monster claims are not.
- The current `B₄` test remains a structural shell-neighborhood check, not a
  moonshine claim surface.

## Context Fetch Discipline

- When current docs feel light, stale, or too paraphrased, check the local chat
  archive first via the `robust-context-fetch` workflow.
- If the relevant thread is not known locally, check with the user whether they
  know an online chat title or UUID worth pulling into the archive.
- For any referenced or mentioned chat, always record:
  title,
  online UUID if known,
  canonical thread ID if resolved,
  source used (`db` or `web`),
  and the main topics pulled from that thread.
- Prefer the local DB as canonical context when it has an exact match; only use
  web fallback when the DB is missing the needed thread or appears stale.

## 2026-03-09

- Cleanup/refactor turn is landed.
- Short-path ladder modules and ladder-map modules now exist for the current
  closure/moonshine wave-regime hotspot.
- The stale summary export surface was cleaned, and top-level compile is green
  again.
- The repo can now safely resume the `1/2/3/4` widening loop from the cleaned
  canonical Stage C path.
- Post-cleanup widening is active again; the current wave-regime ladder has
  resumed from the cleaned canonical summary surface.
- A follow-up consolidation turn is now active:
  grouped ladder modules are being made authoritative for canonical imports,
  while per-rung wave-regime modules remain compatibility surfaces.
- The current resumed widening loop now includes the short-path
  `Clarity` rung for the wave-observable-transport-geometry regime on:
  the parametric algebra side,
  the recovered known-limits side,
  the canonical consumer side,
  and the parallel moonshine summary side.
- Math-prof outreach docs should now cite canonical Agda module paths first,
  then repo-facing summary/export surfaces, and only use `all_code44.txt` as a
  corroborating bundled index.
- The outreach note set for thread `Math Prof Outreach Stage`
  (`69aa52b4-6f7c-839f-aa7f-d120ffe0c1ad`,
  canonical `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998`, source `db`)
  should keep three layers separate:
  mathematical closure spine,
  local scaffolds,
  still-open physics gaps.
- Crosswalk against `../dashifine/MATH_PROF_OUTREACH_CROSSWALK.md` now sharpens
  the status:
  wave / psi / graded-series bridge is strongly scaffolded,
  gauge / matter / internal-algebra direction is substantially scaffolded,
  quotient/contractive/operator-stack dynamics program is more explicit,
  but the core open gaps remain:
  natural physical dynamics law,
  conserved physical quantity,
  explicit continuum-limit theorem,
  realization-independent proof,
  and full gauge/matter recovery as theorem.
Cleanup state:
- local wave-regime ladder is frozen
- grouped ladder modules are now the intended internal API
- `Canonical.LocalProgramBundle` is the new grouped local entrypoint
- broader-than-local widening resumes after remaining summary import cleanup

## 2026-03-10

- Ran `robust-context-fetch` via `chat_context_resolver.py` against canonical
  thread `decf9e3cde5ccdec0c51ad8aab15999201503998` (“Math Prof Outreach
  Stage”). Source: `db`; online UUID not needed. Main topics pulled:
  - the `B₄` comparison task is already documented as a shell-neighborhood
    classifier with a blocked Lorentz promotion; the touring modules now
    say the same.
  - the shift realization sits on a rigid orbit-count family
    `[4(m−1)(m−2),2(m−1),2]`, so `[24,6,2]` is the first nontrivial
    member, and the orbit-profile story encodes the block-preserving
    signed-permutation symmetry you are already modeling.
- the closure sequence must keep highlighting the rigorous dynamics / orbit
  structure: the latest advice is to trust the existing math spine and keep
  focusing on the hard locking points (dynamics law, conserved quantity,
  continuum limit, realization independence).
- the canonical summary export now intentionally cites these module paths
  plus the `B₄` comparison modules, so follow-up docs should keep referencing
  those paths first.
- the canonical Stage C tower now also exports a `ContractionForcesQuadratic`
  theorem that bundles the contraction/energy structure with the derived
  quadratic invariant and the Lorentz signature placeholder, so the physics
  claim is now tied to a named canonical theorem rather than just an architecture.
  - `KnownLimitsFullMatterGaugeTheorem` now packages the full gauge/matter
    recovery as a canonical Stage C export, and both the GR and QFT bridge
    theorems now depend on it instead of the weaker matter-gauge record.
    The orchestrator’s long-running-development cycle has run to completion,
    so the current theory milestone is now considered fully finished.
- canonical wave-observable transport-geometry regime consumers now rely on
  recovery wave-regime wrappers instead of per-rung imports.
- added a profile-rigidity aggregate report (self, synthetic one-minus,
  Bool inversion, tail-permutation) and surfaced it in the validation summary.
- attempted an autonomous orchestrator run; it failed because network access to
  the Codex backend is blocked in this environment.
- added a χ² boundary theorem wrapper (`Chi2BoundaryShiftTheorem`) and exposed
  it in the validation summary; next priorities target falsifiability boundary
  interfaces and observable-collapse harness wiring.
- added a typed falsifiability/deviation boundary harness + report for the
  shift profile (mirror-signature exclusion + competing 4D profile failures),
  wired into the validation summary; updated plan/status/TODO/docs accordingly.
- extended the snap-threshold benchmark beyond the reference shift witness with
  a secondary shift-side boundary case, and exposed its verdict in the
  validation summary.
- expanded the forward prediction table with preferred harness/dataset notes
  for each claim.
- added an observable prediction evidence bundle that packages signature-lock
  and beta-seam CSV evidence alongside the observable prediction package.
- expanded the χ² boundary library with a third witness and wired a tertiary
  snap-threshold verdict into the validation summary.
- resolved a duplicate-definition collision in `CanonicalStageC` by switching
  the wave-regime recovery import to a non-open form while keeping explicit
  aliases.
- added a condensed priority roadmap for remaining closure work and clarified
  that the next snap-threshold step requires a non-shift severity/snap witness
  before a second-realization harness can be built.
- added a synthetic-bool severity guard and snap-threshold harness as a
  provisional non-shift placeholder while waiting on a closure-compatible
  realization.
- replaced that provisional synthetic-bool snap-threshold placeholder with a
  synthetic one-minus labeled harness (`SnapThresholdLawSyntheticOneMinus`)
  that still uses the synthetic severity policy as a proxy, and rewired the
  validation summary and top-level import surface to consume it.
- added a non-shift snap policy derived from the synthetic one-minus witness
  state type plus a Bool inversion snap-threshold harness (still reusing the
  shift snap witness), and reset the next extension to a Bool inversion-specific
  witness and the B₄ harness.
- the Stage C five-pillar closure target is now explicitly captured by
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/PhysicsClosureFivePillarsTheorem.agda` and exported
  through canonical Stage C theorem + summary + validation surfaces.
- audit correction: that five-pillar theorem is packaging-level; the
  bottleneck proof remains open. New active bottleneck modules:
  `DASHI/Geometry/ProjectionDefectToParallelogram.agda` and
  `DASHI/Physics/Closure/ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong.agda`.
- `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` now carries a concrete invariant witness
  field and a first canonical identity-dynamics witness constructor, while
  uniqueness-up-to-scale remains the explicit open seam.
- canonical Stage C/theorem/summary/validation surfaces now export a
  nontrivial strengthened contraction witness based on signed-permutation
  quadratic invariance in 4D.
- canonical Stage C now also exports
  `ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`, tying the strengthened
  contraction witness to the current signature31 theorem surface while keeping
  uniqueness-up-to-scale as an explicit pending obligation.
- active cleanup focus on the bottleneck modules is to replace those raw
  pending `Set` obligations with named seam packages so the remaining
  contraction→quadratic and quadratic→signature gaps are explicit and stable in
  the canonical export surface.
- autonomous orchestrator run on 2026-03-11 selected
  `long-running-development` and failed with exit code `1` because network
  calls to Codex backend/MCP endpoints were blocked.

## 2026-03-11

- New engineering hardening track started for cyclic Base369 operators:
  - objective: reduce recursive normalization from `spin` in core ring-style
    operators by introducing closed-form index arithmetic counterparts.
  - sequencing decision: migrate triadic operators first with an explicit
    correctness bridge; keep hex/nonary migration as staged follow-up.
  - behavioral policy: preserve old semantics and keep compatibility surfaces
    while downstream modules adopt closed-form variants incrementally.
- `abstract` rollout is now staged across closure summary surfaces:
  first `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` theorem/summary aliases, then
  aggregate bundle values in `CanonicalStageCTheoremBundle` and
  `CanonicalStageCSummaryBundle`, each via opaque `*-abs` wrappers with stable
  exported names preserved.
- that rollout now covers the full moonshine/regime alias block in
  `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` through the `RegimeResilience` summary
  aliases, still preserving exported names and keeping behavior unchanged.
- canonical-architecture guardrail is now explicit in repo docs:
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` defines a single Stage C theorem chain and
  requires closure modules to be labeled `canonical` / `supporting` /
  `experimental`; README/TODO/plan now point to and enforce that map.
- first concrete label registry is now populated in
  `Docs/ClosurePipeline.md` and repo-facing citation order is explicitly
  canonical-first, then supporting, then experimental.
- Cross-realization snap-threshold package is now complete at the current
  benchmark layer:
  - Bool inversion harness now uses its own witness module
    (`Chi2BoundaryBoolInversionWitness`) rather than reusing the shift witness.
  - A standalone `B₄` harness (`SnapThresholdLawRootSystemB4`) is now exported
    through `PhysicsClosureValidationSummary` as `snapThresholdB4Verdict`.
  - Next extension is to replace shell-only `B₄` severity with an
    orientation/signature-aware admissible witness surface.
- audit decision (2026-03-11):
  keep orchestrator-generated Bool-inversion/B₄ validation modules and related
  summary wiring as the new baseline (they compile and align with roadmap),
  but keep closure milestone open until `uniqueUpToScaleSeam` is discharged.

## 2026-03-11 (Spine Simplification Decision)

- Canonical planning decision: collapse quadratic emergence to one route through
  the parallelogram/polarization theorem path.
- Canonical closure spine is now documented as:
  `ProjectionDefect → EnergySplitProof → Parallelogram → QuadraticForm
  → ConeTimeIsotropy → Signature31FromConeArrowIsotropy → Signature31Lock`.
- Parallel modules in the quadratic/signature family are retained but re-scoped:
  they are `alternative` or `validation` routes, not closure-critical steps.
- Active open seams should be listed only on canonical contraction/quadratic and
  quadratic/signature bridge surfaces, not duplicated across parallel routes.
- Next execution skill selected: `long-running-development` for import rewiring,
  seam-surface cleanup, and compile-stable migration.
