# Architecture Notes for DashI Closure Path

## Reader Navigation

Use the repo through one canonical map and two reader tracks:

- entry surface: `README.md`
- repo structure guide: `Docs/RepoGuide.md`
- physics/unification guide: `Docs/PhysicsGuide.md`
- compressed claim surface: `Docs/UnificationClaim.md`
- strong theorem owners:
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`,
  `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`
- atom/wave secondary note: `Docs/AtomAndWaveRecoveryStatus.md`
- recovery truth surfaces: `Docs/PhysicsRecoveryLedger.md`, `Docs/ArchiveRecoveryCrosswalk.md`

Classification discipline for those surfaces:

- `proved`: current canonical theorem route and what it strictly establishes
- `bridge`: interpretation layers that connect formal and physics-facing statements
- `packaging`: assembly layers that bundle existing lanes without upgrading claims
- `empirical`: measurement/data lanes with explicit non-claim boundaries
- `speculative`: roadmap or intuition surfaces outside the current theorem contract

## Diagram Entry Points

The canonical textual diagram surfaces for this repo are:

- `Docs/RepoMetasystem.puml`
- `Docs/RepoMetasystem.svg`
- `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.puml`
- `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.svg`
- `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.puml`
- `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.svg`
- `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.puml`
- `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.svg`
- `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.puml`
- `Docs/ObservableSignatureGaugeEntryRound.svg`
- `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.puml`
- `Docs/TRAINING_DYNAMICS.svg`

Regenerate rendered previews with:

```bash
./scripts/render_docs_diagrams.sh
```

Use them in this order:

1. `Docs/RepoMetasystem.*` for repo-level orientation
2. `Docs/CanonicalProofSpine.*` for the canonical theorem route
3. `Docs/PhysicsUnificationMap.*` for claim boundaries and open gaps
4. `Docs/PhysicsRealityRoadmap.*` for "how this touches actual physics"
5. child graphs such as observable/signature and training-dynamics only after the first four

## Canonical Spine (Authoritative)
The canonical closure dependency spine is:

1. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefect`
2. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefectSplitForcesParallelogram`
3. `DASHI.Geometry.ProjectionDefectToParallelogram`
4. `DASHI.Geometry.QuadraticForm`
5. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong`
6. `DASHI.Geometry.CausalForcesLorentz31`
7. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`
8. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
9. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`

This is the only required theorem route for quadratic and signature emergence.

## Strong Claim Owners

The strong repo-native physics-unification claim now lives in code first:

1. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.UnifiedPhysicsTheorem`
2. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem`
3. `DASHI.Physics.Closure.PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter`

Read them in that order.

- `UnifiedPhysicsTheorem` is the main owner for the strong claim.
- `AtomicChemistryRecoveryTheorem` is the atom/chemistry interpretation carrier.
- `PhysicsUnificationToCanonicalClosureAdapter` is the explicit seam between
  abstract `UnifiedClosure.PhysicsUnification` and the canonical
  checklist/package/full-closure story.

## Route Classification Policy
- `canonical`: required for Stage C theorem closure claims.
- `alternative`: mathematically valid alternate derivation; not required.
- `validation`: independent cross-check used to reduce proof-risk.
- `experimental`: speculative or partial scaffolding not used for closure claims.

Modules currently in the quadratic family
(`QuadraticFromNorm`, `QuadraticFromProjection`, `QuadraticFromParallelogram`,
`QuadraticEmergence`, `QuadraticFormEmergence`) should be classified under this
policy and consumed accordingly.

## Remaining Architecture Work
1. Keep `ProjectionDefectToParallelogram` and
   `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong` as the active canonical bottleneck bridge
   surfaces.
2. Replace any raw seam placeholders with named seam packages on canonical
   modules only.
3. Thread signature/Clifford/gauge recovery from canonical spine exports
   instead of parallel emergence routes.
4. Keep signature and Clifford routes logically separate:
   - signature route:
     `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> ContractionQuadraticToSignatureBridgeTheorem`
   - Clifford route:
     `ContractionForcesQuadraticStrong -> QuadraticToCliffordBridgeTheorem`
     (canonical bilinear from normalized quadratic, then Clifford presentation).

## WaveLift⇒Even Architecture Rule (2026-03-11)
1. `Quadratic⇒Clifford` is the sole upstream producer for
   `WaveLift⇒Even` on the canonical path.
2. `WaveLift⇒Even` is a factorization theorem, not a predicate-only claim:
   `State → Cl` must factor through `EvenSubalgebra.incl`.
3. Add explicit Clifford grading interface (`parity`, closure on multiplication,
   unit-even witness) at the canonical Clifford bridge layer.
4. Define canonical wave lift using even Clifford words so image-evenness is by
   construction.
5. Keep this independent from full Dirac operator semantics at this stage.

Current status: implemented and validated with targeted checks on
`CliffordEvenLiftBridge`, `CliffordToEvenWaveLiftBridgeTheorem`,
`CanonicalContractionToCliffordBridgeTheorem`, and
`KnownLimitsQFTBridgeTheorem`.

## Performance Intent
Reducing parallel dependency paths lowers normalization and transport overhead.
Expected effect: lower compile pressure without changing theorem content.
